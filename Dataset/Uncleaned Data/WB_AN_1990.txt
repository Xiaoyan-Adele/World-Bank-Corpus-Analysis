* Continued improvement of the IBRD's re-

10.8 percent at the end of fiscal 1990, up from
10.2 percent a year earlier (see Figure 4-1). That  3

The Bank continues to expand its dialogue
with NGOs on important development-policy
issues of common concern. Many NGOs, in
both developed and developing countries,
want to contribute to the Bank's thinking on a
variety of issues, particularly those related to

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 184 through 201 of this Report present fairly, in
all material respects, in terms of United States dollars. the financial position of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development at June 30, 1990 and 1989, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States and with International Accounting Standards. These financial statements are the responsibility of
management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Note I to the financial statements, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development changed its method of accounting for non-pension retirement benefits during the year ended
June 30, 1990.

Commitment Resources             205
a. IDA reviews periodically the resource position under fully committed replenishments and, if necessary, allocates portions of the resources that become
available for commitment during the fiscal year to those replenishments. For IDA, these allocations include income from operations from January 1, 1985 to
July31, 1989 that tully covered the cumulative losses from operations incurred during the fiscal year from July 1,1979 to December 31, 1984.
The Executive Directors have reviewed iDAs resource position under fully committed replenishments and approved a scheme whereby IDA can annually
increase commitment authority by making advance commitments against the reflows that IDA is projected to receive in future years.
b. Dn July 17, 1989, since all of the African Facility's commitments and encashments had been made, the Executive Directors decided that the African - ,, I,
could rebalance its currency positions to match its obligations with its resources and that the surplus resulting from currency conversion be committed in the
form of supplemental development credits to outstanding African Facility Development Credits on a fast-disbursing basis
