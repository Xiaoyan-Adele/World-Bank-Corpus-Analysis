THAILAND ALTERS ITS DEVELOPMENT PATH
Between i988 and 1996, Thailand's economy grew by 7% a yeari and the share of the population in
poverty droppedfromn 22%  to 11%. But the countiy'sfinancial crisis pushed that share back up to
/3%  in 1998. In response, Tkailand is redirecting its developmnent strategy to reduice inequality, whick
remained high despite all the growth.
The country/s development plan, now more people-centered, has increased resources to the poorer
north and northeast. The objective: to reduce poverty to less than 10% by 2001. A new social inivest-
mentffund helps create jobs and supports social servicesfor poor people. As part of the new strategy, gov-
ernance reforms are geared to increasing accountability and giving authority to local district councils,
which now elect their own officials and commnandgreater resources.

SECTION I
Overview
I n fiscal zooo, the World Bank took important steps, together with its clients, to pave
the way for solid progress in the fight against poverty. Every step involved partners, some
old, some new, many at the country level, some at the global level.
GLOBAL CONTEXT: RECOVERING ECONOMIES,
PERSISTENT CHALLENGES
Economic and financial conditions recovered sharply in 1999 from the trials of the prior two
years. At an estimated 3.3 percent, world economic growth exceeded expectations, led by a strong
United States economy and policy reforms in emerging snarket countries. Global trade recovered
strongly, and commodity prices firmed. These elements will permit more "self-financing" of
development by countries. The present challenge is to sustain and strengthen this economic
turnaround. Global Development Finance 2000 suggests that those countries that rely more heavily
on trade, are more diversified, attract more foreign direct investment, and have become more
competitive are the most likely to sustain growth.
In all regions, progress is evident but obstacles remain. Africa's advances cannot keep
pace with poverty, as conflict persists and HIV/AIDS continues its ravage of the continent's
working-age people as well as of its children. Recovery in crisis-hit East Asia was better than
expected, and the crisis' social impact less than feared, but an overhang of domestic bad debt
clouds the picture. South Asia continued to lead the developing world in growth but poverty
remains entrenched, and conflict situations are diverting public resources. Eastern Europe is
facing challenges of poverty and inequality that were unknown a decade ago. Inequality also
mars Latin American and Caribbean nations' economic and social landscape; in addition,
these countries fell victim to natural disasters during the year. The numbers of poor are also
rising in the Middle East and North Africa region, where, despite economic advances, high
unemployment persists.
The international goal of halving the proportion of the world's population living in
absolute poverty by 2015 is attainable but difficult, according to World Development Indicators 2000
(WDI 2000; see Box s.s; see also "The Poverty Challenge" at the beginning of this report). The
report finds that the goal can be reached if economic growth resumes (and indeed accelerates)

a. To better capture the evolving nature of Bank operations, the Bank's sector classification system is reviewed and changed as appropnate. In fiscal 2000, two new sector categoies
were created (Economic Policy and Private Sector Development) and one sector category was dropped (Industry). Economic Policy comprises operations that support macroeconomic
policy, trade, and other economic and institutional reforms, It includes structural adjustment operations previously assigned to Multisector and some operations previously assigned to
Finance. Private Sector Development comprises operations dealing with the business environment, private infrastructure, small scale enterprise, and privatization issues. As such, it
includes some operations previously assigned to Industry and to Public Sector Management. Other operations previously included under Industry have been assigned to Public Sector
Management. In addition, a few individual operations approved in FY98-99 were reassigned, including an FY99 project from Agriculture to Water Supply and Sanitation.
b. This column shows lending by sector, based on a classification by major loan component. The example of a $100 million mining loan, with components aimed at addressing environ.
mental, financial, and social protection needs, serves as an illustration. In the case of loan-by-loan classification, the full amount of the loan appears in the Mining sector: in the compo-
nent classification, the full amount is spht among the four sectors--Mining, Environment. Finance, and Social Protection. As a result, total lending of $1 .5 billion for Social Protection in
the component classification is the sum of all social protection components within loans approved in fiscal 2000.

SECTION II
The Board of
Executive Directors
T           She Executive Directors are responsible for the conduct of the Bank's gen-
eral operations; they perform their duties under powers delegated by the
Board of Governors. As provided in the Articles of Agreement, 5 of the
24 Executive Directors are appointed by the member countries having
the largest number of shares; the rest are elected by the other member
countries, which form constituencies in an election process conducted every two years.
Executive Directors consider and decide on IBRD loan and IDA credit proposals
made by the President, and they decide on policies that guide the general operations of
the Bank. They are also responsible for presenting to the Board of Governors at the
Annual Meetings an audit of accounts, an administrative budget, and an Annual
Report (this report) on the Bank's operations and policies, as well as any other matters
deemed necessary in their judgment.
During fiscal zooo, Executive Directors regularly met at Bank headquarters twice a
week with frequent additional meetings, both formal and informal, Directors also serve
on one or more of five standing committees: Audit, Development Effectiveness, Budget,
Personnel, and Executive Directors' Administrative Matters. The committees help the
Board discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies
and practices.
In addition, groups of Executive Directors and Alternate Executive Directors period-
ically visit borrowing countries to observe, first-hand, Bank assistance in progress. They
meet with project managers, beneficiaries, government officials, nongovernmental orga-
nizations, the business community, as well as other development partners, financial
institutions, and resident Bank staff In fiscal zooo, Directors visited Indonesia, Kenya,
Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, and the Solomon Islands. Executive Directors' over-
sight responsibility covers all Bank policies and activities, including approval of all len-

or several reasons, effective performance evaluation-understanding what
works and what does not-has taken on a new urgency. Development
risks are on the rise. Local involvement in development programs is
increasing. And governments are more accountable to citizens for devel-
opment effectiveness.
The World Bank strives for development effectiveness by continuously learning
from experience and focusing on quality and results (see Box 3.I). Evaluation is crucial
to these efforts: it strengthens accountability, improves the quality of operations, and
informs strategy, policy, and resource allocation. Since 1997, the Bank's evaluation
strategy has emphasized: participatory evaluation, to actively involve all relevant stake-
holders; knowledge management, to identif$ best practices in development and to
inform Bank and country policies; and "real time" feedback, to help management
assess the performance of projects under implementation.

BOX 4.1 THE CHAD-CAMEROON PETROLEUM
DEVELOPMENT AND PIPELINE PROJECT
The IVorld Bank Board approved support for a project to develop oilfields in southern Chad and to build a 1,070 km
pipeline to off-shore oil loadingfacilities on Cameroon s Atlantic coast. The project will cost an estimated $3.7 billion; its
private sponsors, a consortium of oil companties including ExxonMobil (USA), Petronas (Malaysia), and Chevron (UsA),
are providing the bulk of thefunding. Bank Group support includes s93 million on IBRD terms ($53.4 million to
Cameroon and $39.5 million to Chad) and sioo million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Bank Group role. Financing was only one element of Bank Group supportfor this project. National and international
civil society groups had expressed strong concerns related to the use of oil revenue, the environment, human resettlement, the
project' impact oni indigenous peoples, and public consultations. These groups also tioted that the region's natural resource
"booms" had, in the past, a negative impact on poverty reduction efforts. In response, the Bank, working closely with the gov-
ernments and private sponsors, redoubled its efforts to ensure a project design that would respond to these concerns. The result
was the development in Chad of a sound revenue management program targeting signficantfunds to education, health,
rural development, infrastructure, and environmental management, with to percent of revenue held in trustforfuturegener-
ations, Application of the Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies also resulted in the re-routing of the pipeline
to ensure protection of biodiversity, human settlements, indigenous peoples, and cultural heritage. The pipeline will be buried,
and two large national parks have been newly created. Project-related public consultation started in 1993 and evolved
considerably throughout project preparation. The mFcs role has also been important in mobilizing long-termfinatice and in
supplying technical skillsforfinancing.
Poverty reductionfocus. The project could transform the economy of Chad, one of the world's poorest countries. Nearly
6 million Chadians live on less then si a day, infant mortality is high, amid access to basic social services is extremely limit-
ed. Thegovernmnent'sprogramfor use of the new revenues, estimated at nearly $2 billion for Chad over 25 years, targets key
sectors of its poverty alleviation strategy. Other expected benefits are infrastructure improvements in Cameroon and Chad,
employment getieration, local procurement, capacity building, and increased private investment in both countries.

BOX 4.5 SUPPORTING BHUTAN'S UNIQUE VISION FOR DEVELOPMENT
Nestled in the remote eastern Himalayas, the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan has made great progress in improving the living standards
of its people since first embarking on modernization in the early i96os. Over 70 percent of primary school-age children are now
in school, compared with only35 percent in the early 19705. Bhutan has a unique vision for social transformation: policies aim to
preserve the country's strong cultural and environmental heritage.
Infiscal 2000, the Bank developed a CAS that supports Bhutan's vision and development priorfties. At the country's request,
the strategy emphasizes the transfer of knowledge and ideas, rather thanfinance. In one such initiative, the Bank is helping Bhutan
improve its training of government officials by offering greater access to World Bank Institute courses and internshipsfor promising
Bhutanese civil servants. Close collaboration on analytical and advisory services will lead to shared learning valuable to both
Bhutan and the Bank. The emphasis on such nonlending services is illustrative of an increasing recognition-on the part of coun-
tries and the Bank alike-that knowledge is key to development and to the ffective use of development resources.

Thematic Perspectives
POVERTY IN THE VOICES OF THE POOR
n an effort to understand poverty from the perspective of poor people themselves, the World Bank
undertook a 6o-country participatory study, known as Voices of the Poor. The study was conducted as
background for the itDk 20oo/2002 and consists of two parts: a review of recent participatory
studies in 50 countries involving 40,000 poor women and men; and a comparative study in 1999
involving zo,ooo people in 23 countries.' What emerges is that poverty entails multiple and inter-
locking disadvantages that frequently leave poor people powerless to better their lives.
Poor people emphasize material deprivation but also speak of social, physical and psychological
dimensions and lack of freedom of choice and action. Their livelihoods are often precarious, seasonal and
inadequate; many see economic conditions worsening. Their villages and slums are often isolated, lacking
in basic services and transport. Hunger and illness are common, and access to medical care, difficult.
Especially in urban areas, crime and violence pose daily threats; police protection is scarce. Within the
household, domestic violence against women remains widespread even though more poor women are earn-
ing incomes than ever before. Descriptions of poverty also often encompass mental distress and anxiety
about the future. "Poverty is lack of freedom, enslaved by crushing daily burdens, by depression and fear
of what the future will bring," says a participant from the Caucuses.
Poor people highlight powerlessness, pointing to officials, traders and civic actors who are neither
responsive nor accountable to them. They share numerous examples of criminality, abuse and corruption in
encounters with public institutions, saying they have little recourse to justice. "Government has let us down,
too many promises-never fulfilling them)' says a 30-year-old unemployed mother from the Caribbean. In
poor communities worldwide, local groups and actors are key supports; however, poor people recognize
limits to how much "one hungry man can help another hungry man."

2000, expressing an unqualified opinion and including explanatory paragraphs
concerning the basis of accounting used to prepare the special purpose financial

Standards and the change in accounting policy for the HIPC Debt Initiative (which are
not included herein), are included in The World Bank Annual Report 2000: Financial
Statements and Appendixes to the Annual Report. The accompanying condensed special
purpose financial statements are the responsibility of the International Development
