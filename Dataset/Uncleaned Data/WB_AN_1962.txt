WASHINGTON, D. C.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in terms of
United States currency, the financial position of International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-
ment at June 30, 1962, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year. Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing
procedures as we considered necessary.
