Assistance for agriculture
In agriculture, as in industry, an increasingly
important objective of Bank and IDA lending
is to spread the benefits of development more
widely. Agricultural lending in the region rose    3       .       '.4
to $289.4 million in fiscal 1973, bringing the                    ,45 24

than eight times the figure for the previous five          2            - 4          1
years. The region now accounts for about 30%0/
of all Bank and IDA financing for agriculture
around the world. As in other regions, the pro-
portion devoted to dams and major irrigation
works has declined in recent years. Instead,
the emphasis has been on extension services,
on-farm development, and agricultural credit.
Feasibility studies and technical assistance have                   -.'w
been financed more often. Greater attention
has also been given to the broader objectives
of rural development and employment.
Several projects supported by the Bank and                                   _
IDA in recent years have reflected an innova-
tive approach: agricultural research in Spain,
in-shore fisheries in Tunisia and the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen, and new tech-
niques in drainage projects in Egypt and Iraq.
Agriculture in the region is so diverse, and so
full of contrasts, that each year brings a new
mix of projects. In some countries, farmers
produce fruit, vegetables and flowers for the
quality-conscious European market. In others,
they wring a precarious subsistence from  un-
yielding desert soils. Some countries have a
competitive advantage in producing livestock                                                 U
for export. In others, fish are plentiful in the
adjacent seas, but diets are seriously short of
protein because the catch cannot be moved
inland without modern transport and preserva-
tion facilities. Agricultural institutions provide
similar contrasts. Some countries have modern
and efficient agricultural credit banks. Others
are taking the first steps towards providing
credit to small farmers.
In the circumstances, Bank and IDA agricul-
tural lending in the region has covered projects    will directly assist the development of private

(1r In the 1973 edition, the annual real growth rates and shares in GNP for individual years have been smoothed by
shifting to three year centered moving averages.

Of the three year moving averages.
