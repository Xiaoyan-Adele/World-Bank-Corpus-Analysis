the advantage of assistance from Unesco. In the

member countries, 26 of them in cooperation with
Unesco. In the field of agricultural training, FAQ
also cooperated in joint missions. At the close of
the fiscal year, nine education projects were being

WASHINGTON, D.C.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in
terms of United States currency, the financial position of International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development at June 30, 1966, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with that of the preceding year. Our examination of these statements was made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such
tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered
necessary.

In our opinion, the accompanying.financial statements present fairly, in
terms of United States currency, the financial position of International Development As-
sociation at June 30, 1966, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent
with that of the preceding year. Our examination of these statements was made in accord-
ance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included review of the
allocation of expenses incurred jointly with International Bank for Reconstruction and De-
velopment, tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we
considered necessary.
