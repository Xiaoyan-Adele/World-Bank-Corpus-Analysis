The World Bank
The World Bank is a group of three
institutions, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the
International Development Association (IDA),
and the International Finance Corporation
(IFC).
The common objective of these institutions
is to help raise standards of living in developing
countries by channeling financial resources
from developed countries to the developing
world.
The Bank was established in December1945,
and makes loans at a rate which is calculated
in accordance with a formula related to its cost
of borrowing. The Bank's charter spells out
certain basic rules which govern its operations.
It must lend only for productive purposes, and
pay due regard to the prospects of repayment.
Each loan is made to a government or must be
guaranteed by the government concerned. The
use of loans cannot be restricted to purchases
in any particular member country. And the
Bank's decisions to lend must be based only
on economic considerations.
The International Development Association
was established in 1960 to provide assistance
for the same purposes as the Bank, but on
terms that would bear less heavily on the
balance of payments of the borrowing
countries. Though legally and financially
distinct from the Bank, IDA is administered by
the same staff. IDA's assistance is concentrated
on countries which are very poor-mainly
those with an annual per capita gross national
product of less than $375. More than 40
countries are eligible under this criterion. They
include more than 80% of the population of
the 100 countries that are current borrowers
from the Bank, IDA, or both. About 74% of the
people living in IDA-eligible countries live in
Asia, 14% in Africa south of the Sahara, 9.5%
in the Middle East and North Africa, and 2.50%
in Latin America and the Caribbean area.
While the Bank has traditionally financed all
kinds of infrastructure facilities such as roads,
railways, and power facilities, its present
developmental strategy places a greatly
increased emphasis on investments which can
directly affect the well-being of the masses of
poor people of developing countries by
making them more productive and by
including them as active participants in the
development process. This strategy is
increasingly evident in the rural development,
agriculture, and education projects which the
Bank and IDA help finance. The same strategy
is also being carried out for the benefit of the
urban poor in projects designed to develop
water and sewerage facilities as well as "core"
low-cost housing, and to increase the
productivity of small industries.

by large inflows of foreign capital, mainly from
OPEC members, Pakistan consortium sources,
the International Monetary Fund, and the Bank.
There are, however, major areas of concern
in Pakistan's economic outlook. The attainment
of satisfactory long-run growth and a favor-
able balance of payments requires a marked
rise in agricultural and industrial production,
combined with a substantial increase in do-
mestic savings, so that exports can be expanded
and reliance on foreign capital decreased.
Pakistan has ample potential for meeting
these requirements, but the task is a demand-
ing one. A revival of more rapid agricultural
aevelopment is particularly crucial along the
promising lines of increasing the area and pro-
ductivity of high-yielding foodgrain varieties,
expanding and arranging for more effective
management of the irrigation system, and pro-
moting better use of water at the farm level.
Agricultural programs along these lines, to-
gether with expansion and improved efficiency
in the industrial sector, are expected to be in-
cluded in a medium-term  Pakistan develop-
ment plan now  in preparation. Meanwhile,  
steps have been taken for the near future to        -
increase the share of domestic resources avail-
able for development, to raise the share of de-
velopment outlays on agriculture, to improve
incentives for agricultural production, and to
promote the expansion of exports.

capacity. To support the Colombian Govern-
ment's policy of industrial decentralization,
important features of a project, to which the
Bank loaned $80 million (to be relent to indus-
trial companies), included explicit support for
the creation of new firms, for the financing of
existing firms sponsoring decentralization proj-
ects, and for giving increasing importance to
environmental impact considerations in the
appraisal of investment projects. In addition to
Promoting the growth of manufacturers' ex-
ports, another important objective of the loan
was to assist firms to undertake technology
improvement programs so as to become more
competitive through production efficiency and
product quality.
The main objective of a loan totaling $20
million ($3 million of which was on Third Win-
dow terms) to the Caribbean Development
Bank (CDB) was to strengthen that important
regional institution and thereby assist in the
economic development and integration of the
12 English-speaking countries and territories of
the Caribbean region. A distinguishing feature
of the loan included the financing of a wide
range of public and private sector projects in
agriculture, agro-industry, manufacturing, tour-
ism, transportation, public utilities, "sites and
services," and technical and vocational educa-
tion training in CDB member countries. The
World Bank is increasingly looking to the CDB
as a channel for funds to support national and

international institution and its related financial policies, which are
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related

not deem the application of this accounting principle to be appropri-

The Special Reserve and the General Reserve have been restated
for presentation in the balance sheet under the heading Capital
and Reserves as described in Note D.
In our opinion, the financial statements examined by us present
fairly, in terms of United States currency, the financial position of
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at June 30,
1976 and 1975, and the results of its operations and changes in its
financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis after restatement for the change, with which we concur,
described in the preceding paragraph.
