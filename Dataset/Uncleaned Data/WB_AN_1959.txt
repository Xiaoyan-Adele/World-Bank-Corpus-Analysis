fairly, in terms of United States currency, the financial position of International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development at June 30, 1959, and the results of
its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year. Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the account-
ing records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary.

INTERNATIONAL 3ANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIENT
Supplement to the
Fourteenth Annual Report
A Summary of Bank Activities
from
July 1, 1959 to January 31, 1960
MERMBERSHIP
Applications for membership from Laos and Portugal were approved
'oy the 3oard of Governors at the 1959 Annual Meeting. Their subscrip-
tions will be `10 million and `;80 million respectively.
CAPITAL SUBSCRIPTION
On September 15, 1959, the authorized capital of the Bank was
increased from plO billion to 121 billion.  By January 31, 1960, 47
member governments had doubled their subscriptions and 12 members had
subscribed to  804.2 million in addition to their 100% increases.
(See Annex.) As a result of these increases, subscribed capital rose
from 19.5 billion to '$18.7 billion by January 31.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPL-NT ASSOCIATION
Pursuant to a request of the Board of Governors, the Bank's
Executive Directors drew up Articles of Agreement for the International
Development Association (IDA), the proposed new financing organization
to be an affiliate of the Bank. The Articles were transmitted to the
Bank's 68 member countries for acceptance on January 29, 1960. When
members whose subscriptions aggregate 65% of IDA's initial resources
have accepted membership and subscribed to the Association, the
Articles will come into force. The Articles will remain open for
signature by original members until December 31, 1960; the earliest
date on which IDA may come into being is September 15, 1960.
IDA would be a new source of international development capital
and is designed to promote the development of the less developed areas
of the world included in its membership. It would make long-term loans
on more lenient terms than those of the Bank, providing additional de-
velopment assistance on terms bearing less heavily on the balance of
payments of the recipient country than conventional loans. The Articles
envisage a broad degree of flexibility in IDA's operations, not only in
the terms of its lending but also in the projects which may be financed.
Projects must be of "high developmental priority" and this is under-
stood to allow IDA to finance projects such as water supply and pilot
housing as well as projects of the type which the Bank has been accus-
tomed to finance.



-2-
The initial resources of IDA from member governments1 subscriptiors
are proposed as '11 billion, the subscriptions being roughly proportion-
ate to subscriptions in the Bank. In the paynent and. use of subscrip-
tions, however, IDA is to have its own formula: 17 of the more industri-
alized member countries will pay their entire subscriptions in gold or
freely convertible currencies over the first five years, in contrast to
only 10% to be so paid by the rermaining 51 less developed member coun-
tries. The 90% balance of the subscriptions of the latter group will
be paid in their national currencies, and would be available for con-
version by IDA or for use to finance exports from the subscribing
member's territories, only with the consent of that member.
LETDING ACTIVITIES
Since July 1 the Bank has made 16 loans totaling the equivalent of
6366.7 million in Algeria and Sahara, Austria, Chile, Colombia, India
(two loans), Iran, Italy, Japan (two loans), Norway, Pakistan (three
loans), United Arab Republic and Uruguay. At January 31, 1960, the
gross total of Bank lending was 34,888.6 million, made up of 250 loans
in 51 countries and territories.

ALGERIA AND SAHARA
Oil Pipeline Loan
$50 million 12-year 6% loan of December 10, 1959
to Societe Petroliere de Gerance.
The loan will help to finance the cost of constructing and oper-
ating a 412-mile pipeline to bring crude oil from the Hassi Messaoud
oilfield in the Sahara to the Algerian port of Bougie on the Mediter-
ranean coast. As of June 1959 proven primary recoverable reserves at
Hassi Messaoud were estimated to be about 170 million metric tons, with
a probable reserve of another 130 million tons. The pipeline came into
limited operation in December 1959.  Additional pumps and pumping
stations will be installed in successive stages to bring the pipeline
up to its design capacity of about 14a million tons annually by 1961.
The petroleum resources of Hassi Messaoud will provide Algeria and
the Sahara with new sources of raw materials and low-cost fuel and power
for industry, as well as with important budget revenues from royalties
and taxes. Furthermore when the pipeline is operating at capacity, the
supply of oil should enable the French franc area as a whole to save or
earn the equivalent of about 3200-250 million a year in foreign exchange.
The total cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent of
j$105 million. The loan agreement provides that the Bank itself will not
be commnitted to put up more than 425 million; it is expected that the



balance of A,$25 million will be obtained in due course in the form of
participations in the Bank loan.
UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC
Loan for Suez Canal Improvements
_,06.5 million 15-year 6% loan of December 22, 1959
to the Suez Canal Authority.
The loan will assist in the execution of a program to widen and
deepen the Suez Canal so that it can accommodate ships with a draft of
37 feet compared to the present maximum, of 35 feet, or ships of about
46,000 dead-weight tons compared with the present 36,000.  When the pro-
gram is completed in 1961, the Suez Canal Authority will also have the
modern plant and equipment it will need to provide ships using the Canal
with efficient service.
The Canal provides passage for ocean-going vessels between the
Mediterranean and Red Seas, and shortens the sea voyage between Asia
and Western Surope by about 5,000 miles. During 1958 35% of all ocean-
going vessels and 60% of all oil tankers, with a gross tonnage exceed-
ing 4,000 tons, passed through the Canal at least once.  Traffic has
grown steadily and now amounts to 18,000 ships and 140 nillion tons of
cargo a year, of which 70% is oil mainly from the Middle East.  While
the discovery of new oilfields outside the Middle East may slow the rate
of traffic growth, the need to improve the Canal stems not only from
growing traffic but also to a large extent from the increase in the
size of tankers seeking transit.
Under the loan agreement, the Suez Canal Authority will keep
funds in reserve from its current revenues in order to provide the ser-
vice for the Bank loan.
A S I A
INDIA
Railway Loan
650 million 20-year 6% loan of July 15, 1959 to
India.
The loan will assist in the expansion and modernization of the
Indian Railways, the fourth largest railway system in the world.  The
railway program is a central part of India's Second Five-Year Plan, and
accounts for about one-quarter of all public expenditures under the Plan.
During the Plan period the Railways are raising freight capacity
from 114 to 168 million tons annually and are increasing passenger
capacity by 15%. The total expenditures involved are estimated at the



equivalent of about "2,355 million.  By the end of the programls third
year, M,,arch 31, 1959, expenditures -were about three-fifths complete, and
in 1958 the volume of railway freight traffic originating in India had
reached a total of 132 million tons; for the first time in many years
the Railways were able to handle all the freight offered.
The Bank has now lent `225 million for the current railway pro-
gram; the new loan will be applied mainly to expenditures for imported
equipment, materials and services during the fourth year of the Plan
ending MvIarch 31, 1960.
Loan for Private Industry
JO million 10-year loan of July 15, 1959 to
the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
of India Ltd. (ICICI).
This loan will be used by ICICI to finance foreign exchange re-
quirements of private industrial projects. The Corporation was estab-
lished in January 1955 by private investors of India, the United King-
dom and the United States to assist the growth of private industry in
India. Up to May 1959, it had approved investments and underwritings
amounting to the equivalent of 433 million.  The orincipal sectors
assisted by the Corporation have been mechanical, electrical and
automotive industries, paper, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, sugar
and shipping. ICICIts access to foreign exchange orovided by an
earlier World Bank loan of JO million has been of" particular value
to private industry in the past year when India's foreign exchange
resources have been strained. The new Bank loan should meet the Cor-
poration's foreign exchange requirements through most of 1961.
Each part of the loan allocated to a particular project will
carry its own interest rate, which will be the Bank's current rate of
interest at the time the project is apoproved for financing.
I R A N
Loan for Private Industry
4P_5.2 million 15-year loan of November 23, 1959 to
the Industrial and Wining Development Bank of Iran.
The Industrial and W'fiining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI) was
formed in October 1959 by private investors in Iran, the United States,
the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, Holland and Italy.  IIKBI
will stimulate private industrial development in Iran by making medium
and long-term loans and by investing in share capital.  It will promote
and help to develop a capital market; guarantee loans and comitments of
other investors; and provide technical and managerial assistance to
Iranian industry.
While the Iranian economy depends mainly on agriculture and oil,
industry has also been developing rapidly in recent years.  Iran produces



- 5 -
most of its cotton textiles and a large portion of its cement, wood pro-
ducts and sugar. The processing of other indigenous products, the manu-
facture of many articles now imported, the exploitation of the country's
mineral resources, and the development of the petro-chemical industry
afford a significant potential for private enterprise.
The IMDBI started operations with resources equivalent to z-42.4
million made up of share capital of 400 million rials (5.3 million)
subscribed by Iranian and foreign investors; an advance of 600 million
rials ($8 million) from the Government of Iran, and an existing loan
portfolio of 1,400 million rials (18,7 million) which the Government
turned over to IMDBI for management (funds arising from repayment of
these loans will be available to IMDBI for reinvestment); a loan of
$5.2 million from the U.S. Development Loan Fund and the loan of 6P5.2
million from the World Bank.
Each part of the loan allocated to a particular project will carry
its own interest rate, which will be the Bank's current rate of interest
at the time the project is approved for financing.
JAPAN
Steel Loans
$24 million 15-year 6% loan of November 12, 1959
to the Japan Development Bank for re-lending to
the Fuji Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.
$20 million 15-year 6% loan of November 12, 1959
to the Japan Development Bank for re-lending to
the Yawata Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.
The loans will assist the Yawata and Fuji companies, Japan's two
largest steel producers, in expanding and modernizing their facilities
to greatly increase their pig iron and ingot steel capacity. These com-
panies account for a large part of the current program of the whole
Japanese iron and steel industry. The program's objective is to expand
crude steel capacity from 11.1 million to 20.5 million tons in the period
1956-62; to install facilities for producing a higher quality and wider
range of steel products; and to reduce operating costs by introducing the
most modern techniques of production. The industry is also expanding
pig iron capacity to make possible the increase in steel production with-
out increasing the nation's dependence on imported scrap.
The U 20 million loan for the Yawata Company is for the installation
of facilities at the company's Tobata plant in northern Kyushu to make it
a fully integrated steel plant. The loan will cover about 17% of the
estimated total cost equivalent to "1117.6 million. The 0*24 million lQan
for the Fuji Company is for the construction of works at the company's
plant at Hirohata in Honshu on the inland sea. The new facilities will
enable Fuji to increase its production of plates and sheets; also, by



-6-
permitting a fuller utilization of existing rolling mills, it will in-
crease the company's earning power.  The loan will cover about )2% of the
estimated total cost equivalent to $75.3 million.
PAKISTAN
Electric Power Loan
$2.4 million 15-year 6% loan of August 13, 1959
to the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Ltd.
(KESC).
This loan will finance the foreign exchange cost of a 15,000-
kilowatt diesel power plant to provide rapid reinforcement of power
supplies to the Karachi area. This is the third Bank loan to KESC
for the expansion of its electric power facilities. The earlier loans
totaled p327.8 million and were for the construction of a 30,000-kilowatt
steam pow,[er plant and the later expansion of this plant by 60,000 kilo-
watts. The 60,000-kilowatt unit, however, cannot come into operation
before 1962 and in the meantime scarcity of power is limiting Pakistan's
industrial production. The Government therefore asked KESC to take
emergency measures to expand its services. The new diesel plant being
financed by the current loan will be in cperation by the middle of 1960,
enabling KESC to meet pent up industrial demand and still have a margin
of capacity to meet further increases in the following two years.
Loan for Private Industry
^`10 million 10-year loan of September 25, 1959 to
the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corpor-
ation, Limited (PICIC).
This loan, like an earlier Bank loan of 4.2 million, will be used
by PICIC to finance the foreign exchange requirements of private industrial
projects. PICIC was established in September 1957 by Pakistani investors,
together with British, Canadian, American and Japanese private interests,
to promote the growth of private industry in Pakistan. By Kay 1959 the
Corporation had approved 67 loans totaling the equivalent of 412 million,
of which 42 have been in foreign exchange amounting to the equivalent of
07.8 million.  Sugar and textile industries have been the largest bor-
rowers and others include food processing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals,
mechanical, glass and ceramics.
The marked revival of investment activity in Pakistan since early
1959 and the country's continued stringent foreign exchange situation re-
sulted in a considerable increase in the demand on PICIC's resources.
PICIC5's additional foreign exchange requirements through 1961 are esti-
mated at $20 million wghich will be met by the Bank loan, and a A,G1 mil-
lion loan from the United States Development Loan Fund.

Each part of the Bank loan allocated to a particular project will
carry its own interest rate, which will be the Bank's current rate of
interest at the time the project is approved for financing.
Railway Loan
$12.5 million 15-year 6% loan of November 30, 1959
to Pakistan.
The loan will assist in financing an interim program designed to
meet the minimum requirements of the Pakistan railways pending the formu-
lation of a program of railway development to be carried out during the
period of Pakistants Second Five-Year Plan.
Pakistan has two railway systems: one is the chief form of trans-
port in West Pakistan and the other serves East Pakistan. Since 1955
the volume of traffic has increased at an annual rate of 6% in West
Pakistan and the increase has been even more rapid in East Pakistan.
While the railways are well managed, efficiency of operation has been
hampered by inadequate line and yard capacity and by a shortage of sig-
naling equipment and rolling stock. The Bank's loan will be applied to
the purchase of essential goods and equipment needed to ease this situ-
ation.
E U R 0 P E
AUSTRIA
Loan for Industry
c$9 million loan of September 25, 1959 to the
Oesterreichische Investitionskredit, A.G.
The Investitionskredit will make the proceeds of this loan avail-
able to private industrial companies for the expansion or modernization
of their plants.
When the Investitionskredit was established in 1957 to meet the
need for long-term capital for private industrial enterprises, the Bank
made it a loan of `$10,765,000 (since reduced to $9.3 million at the re-
quest of the borrower). This loan helped to finance nine projects in the
pulp, paper board, textile, and electrical engineering industries.  Since
that time, the Investitionskredit has increased its equity capital to the
equivalent of approximately $5.5 million. At the institution's present
rate of lending, its loan funds were expected to be fully committed by
the end of 1959. The new Bank loan should provide sufficient funds for
the next two years.
The loan will finance projects to be selected by the Investitions-
kredit and approved by the Bank.  Each part of the loan allocated for a



particular project will carry its own interest rate, which will be the
Bank's current rate of interest at the time the project is approved for
financing. Similarly, separate amortization schedules will be agreed
upon and determined in accordance with the circumstances of the ultimate
borrower. The loan must be fully repaid by October 1, 1974.
ITALY
Nuclear Power Loan
)40 million 20-year 6% loan of September 16, 1959 to
the Cassa per il NViezzogiorno.
The loan will finance 60% of the cost of constructing a 150,000-
kilowatt atomic power plant on the Garigliano River between Rome and
Naples. This was the Bank's first loan for the development of nuclear
power.
The Cassa per il Mezzogiorno will re-lend the proceeds of the
loan to the Societa Elettronucleare Nazionale (SENN), a company estab-
lished in 1957 to build, own and operate the nuclear power plant. Power
from the new plant will be fed into the transmission systems of SENN's
utility shareholders, covering about half of Italy and serving more
than half the population. Power demand in the service area is growing
rapidly; studies have indicated that it will be necessary to increase
capacity from 4,140,000 to 7,250,000 kilowatts in the period 1958-1964.
A particular advantage to the power system from the SENN plant will be
the experience gained; nuclear power plants can be expected to meet a
growing portion of Italian power requirements in the years to come.
The project was the outcome of a study carried out jointly by the
Italian Government and the Bank to establish the technical, economic
and financial merits of a nuclear power plant in Southern Italy. As
part of the study, tenders were invited on an international basis and
nine companies -- British, French and American -- submitted tenders.
The plant will be built by General Electric Company of New York through
a Swiss subsidiary and will incorporate a nuclear reactor cooled and
moderated by boiling water and fueled by enriched uranium. Construc-
tion of the civil works, substation and transmission lines will be
carried out by SENN. The plant is expected to be in commercial oper-
ation by late 1963.
NORWAY
Electric Power Loan
020 million 25-year 6% loan of July 8, 1959 to
the Kingdom of Norway.
The loan will help to finance the construction of two hydroelectric
power plants in the mountains of central Norway, with a combined capacity



_9-_
of 168,000 kilowatts.  Half the power from the plants will supply the region
served by the grid centered around the Trondheim area, and the remainder will
be exported to Sweden. The loan will also assist the construction of 350
miles of transmission lines to reinforce and interconnect the power grids in
middle and Southern Norway.
4k               The proceeds of the loan will be made available to the Norwegian Water-
course and Electricity Board, an agency of the Government.  The Board now oper-
ates plants having a capacity of 1,163,000 kilowattsv  To meet the demands for
additional power, the Board is constructing other power plants which will add
680,000 kilowatts to its systems, including the 400,000-kilowatt Tokke power
plant for which the World Bank made a loan of >$25 million in 1956,
W E S T E R N H E M I S P H E R E
CHILE
Electric Power Loan
$32.5 million 25-year 6% loan to Empresa Nacional de Electrici-
dad S.A. (Endesa) and Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion
(Fomento).
The loan will help to finance a 280,000-kilowatt hydroelectric plant to be
built on the Rapel River about 75 miles southwest of Santiago, and a 15,000-
kilowatt thermal electric plant at the port of Huasco in northern Chile.
The Rapel project includes the construction of a concrete dam 300 feet high
to create a reservoir to store 570,000 acre feet of water; the power house; and
about 225 miles of transmission lines to serve Santiago and Valparaiso, the two
largest cities in Chile and their surrounding areas.  About 25,000 acres of land
will be irrigated by water drawn from the reservoir. The central part of Chile
which is to be served by the Rapel plant contains the leading centers of indus-
trial, commercial and agricultural activity.  In 1958 industrial consumption ac-
counted for 45% of the total. For many years a shortage of power has made it
necessary to restrict consumption in the area. As additional power becomes
available, the annual growth of consumption is expected to rise from 7% to
about 14% over the next five years,.
The area to be served by the Huasco thermal plant needs additional power
for its main industry,mining -- principally iron ore, copper and manganese.  The
high grade iron ore in this part of Chile is a valuable export product and the
development of the mines has therefore high economic priority.  The existing
power plants are now fully loaded and the Huasco plant will provide a firm
supply of power for the expansion of mining operations.
COLOMBIA
Electric Power Loan
317.6 million 25-year 6% loan of January 20, 1960 to Empresa
de Energia Electrica de Bogota.
Bogota, the capital of Colombia and one of the chief industrial and com-
mercial centers, has for many years been subject to restrictions on the use of
electricity.  The project for which this loan was made will add 117,000 kilowatts



- 10 -
of generating capacity to the system serving the city and its surrounding area,
or nearly double the present capacity. Included in the project is the construc-
tion of a darn, a new 66,000-kilowatt power plant, to be known as Salto II, and
the addition of an 18,000-kilowatt unit to an existing plant, both of which will
further utilize the hydroelectric power potential of the Bogota River. Other
works being undertaken are the installation of a 33,000-kiloTwTatt thermal power
plant and extensive improvement and rehabilitation of Empresa's transmission and
distribution facilities. These projects are part of an expansion program which
by 1970 would add about 400,000 kilowatts of new capacity to the 128,000 presently
available for the Bogota area.
URUGUAY
Pasture and Livestock Loan
[,7 million 12-year 6% loan of December 30, 1959 to Uruguay
The loan will assist in the execution of a pilot program to foster the
application of modern techniques in pasture development and livestock produc-
tion. This program is of great potential imoortance to the economic development
of Uruguay where meat, wool and other pastoral products represent about 58% of
the value of agricultural production and 80% of all exports.
Under the program technical and financial assistance will be provided to a
pilot group of operators of 600 livestock farms with a combined area of about
1-1/2 million acres. Included in the program is improve-ment of pastures and soil
fertility by fertilizing and re-seeding; sub-division of the farms by additional
fencing to permit controlled rotational grazing; provision of additional water
points in sub-divided pastures; conservation of forage for supplemental feeding;
and better control of livestock diseases. In three years, the pilot program is
expected to result in a ',3-4 million annual increase in the incomes of partici-
pating farms and, since nearly all the new production will be sold abroad, ex-
port earnings should rise nearly as much.
GKE:AL 'SURVEY _IISSIONS
"A Public Development Program for Thailand," the report of the Bank's
General Survey Mission to Thailand was published in Seotember 1959. Two members
of the General Survey M1ission to Libya went to Libya in January 1960 to discuss
the draft report with the Government before formal presentation of the report.
The General Survey Mission, which spent three months from June to September 1959
in Tanganyika, had by the end of January nearly completed its draft report. A
General Survey Mission was in Venezuela from September to December 1959 and at
the end of January had begun preparation of its report.
FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
Earnings and Reserves
Net earnings in the seven months ending January 31, 1960 amounted to `34
million, all of Twhich was credited to the Supplemnental Reserve against losses
on loans and guarantees. In addition, the Bank's Special Reserve increased by
215 million during that period. On January 31, the total of these reserves
amounted to 4469 million.



- 11 -
Funded Debt
The funded debt of the Bank was increased by a net amount of Y58.5 mil-
lion during the period, bringing the total outstanding funded debt of the Bank
to the equivalent of ,1,963.7 million on January 31.
.
In this period new bond issues and private placements of Bank obligations
amounted to the equivalent of $162.9 million.  These consisted of a public issue
of 10 million (328 million) of sterling stock and four private placements of
obligations totaling $134.9 million, including DM10 million ($2.4 million) of
Deutsche mark notes. Outstanding debt was increased a further $24.1 million as
a result of the delivery of $11.3 million of bonds which had been subject to
delayed delivery arrangements and through the drawing down of an additional $12.8
million equivalent from the Deutsche Mark Note of 1958. Repayment of debt through
bond maturities and regular purchase and sinking fund transactions amounted to
41)128.5 million.
In addition, the Bank arranged to borrow DM200 million ($M7.6 million) by
private placement. Under the agreement, the amount can be drawn down from time
to time over 12 months beginning January 31, 1960. The Bank has not yet drawn
any amount.
Sales of Borrowers' Obligations
Private investors participated directly in 11 of the 16 loans that were
made between July 1, 1959 and January 31, 1960. These participations -- all
without the Bankts guarantee -- amounted to '$24.3 million and took place in
connection with loans in Chile, Colombia, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Pakistan
and the United Arab Reoublic.
Including these participations, the Dank sold or agreed to sell the equiva-
lent of '88 million principal amounts of loans during the seven-month period.
At January 31, the total amount of such sales was -$656 million, of which all but
$69 million were sold without the Bankls guarantee.
