My dear Mr. Chairman:

   In accordance with Section 8 of the By-Laws
of the International Finance Corporation,
I have been authorized by the Board of
Directors to submit to the Board of Governors
this Inaugural Report of the Corporation. It
covers developments during the period from
July 24, 1956, the date on which the Corpora
tion's Articles of Agreement became effective,
to September 15, 1956.
                       Sincerely yours,




                        R. L. Garner
                           President




Chairman, Board of Governors
International Finance Corporation
             THIS INAUGURAL REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE
             CORPORATION is submitted after only two months of actual
             operations. During that time, the Corporation has made consider
             able progress in establishing a working organization, adopting
             operating policies for the initial stage of its activities, developing
             working procedures and recruiting staff. While it has not yet
             engaged in any financing operations, it has received a variety of
             inquiries, several of them of considerable interest and promise.


             ESTABLISHlVIENT OF THE CORPORA TION

             On April 14, 1955, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
             Development formally transmitted to its member governments
             for their consideration proposed Articles of Agreement for the
             International Finance Corporation. By its terms, the Agreement
             was to enter into force when membership had been accepted by
             not less than 30 governments whose capital subscriptions aggre
             gated not less than $75 million. This condition was satisfied on
             July 20, 1956. The inaugural meeting of the Board of Directors
             was held on July 2<'t, 1956, and, according to the provisions of its
             charter, the Corporation began operations on that date. It then
             had 31 members, with subscriptions totalling $78,366,000.


             J1EAfBERSHIP

             As of September 15, the Corporation has 32 members, whose
             subscriptions total $78,382,000. A list of members and the sub
             scriptions of each member are set forth in Appendix A to this
             Report. Other countries which were members of the Bank on
             April 14, 1955, may become original members of the Corporation
             by joining not later than December 31, 1956. All but three of
             these countries have expressed their intention to join.

GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS
The Articles of Agreement provide that each Governor of the
Bank appointed by a member which is also a member of the
Corporation shall be a Governor of the Corporation, and that the
Corporation's Board of Directors shall be composed of those
Executive Directors of the Bank who represent at least one
government which is a member of the Corporation. The Cor
poration's Governors and Directors as of September 15 are listed
in Appendices Band C, respectively.

APPOINT,UENT OF THE PRESIDENT AND OFFICERS
Upon recommendation of the Chairman of the Board, the Board
of Directors unanimously appointed Mr. Robert L. Garner,
formerly Vice President of the Bank, to serve as President of the
Corporation.
     I\h. Garner appointed Mr. J. G. Beevor as Vice President of
the Corporation, to serve as Deputy of the President and as
General Manager of the Corporation. He also appointed Mr.
Richard H. Demuth to be Assistant to the President, and Mr.
Davidson Sommers to be General CounseL Mr. Beevor was
previously Nlanaging Director of the Commonwealth Develop
ment Finance Company, Ltd. of London. IVlr. Demuth and Mr.
Sommers have been and will continue to be ofIieers of the Bank as
well as of the Corporation.
     The Secretary, Treasurer, Director of Administration and
Director of Information of the Bank have been appointed to the
same positions in the Corporation. Other Bank staff members
who are under the supervision of these officers will, when acting
for the Corporation, have substantially the same authority and
responsibilities as they have in the Bank. In addition, Mr. Robert
'V. Cavanaugh, Chief of the Fiscal Division of the Treasurer's
Department of the Bank, has been appointed Assistant Treasurer
of the Corporation.

                                                                3
    BY-LAWS AND RULES OF PROCEDURE

    At the inaugural meeting of the Board of Directors, By-Laws for
    the Corporation and Rules of Procedu~e for meetings of the
    Board of Directors were adopted. The By-Laws are being sub
    mitted to the Board of Governors for approval, and the Rules of
    Procedure are being submitted for review.


    PAYMENT OF CAPITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS

    At its inaugural meeting, the Board of Directors decided that
    each government which was then a member of the Corporation
    should be called upon to pay in full its subscription to the Cor
    poration's capital stock by the close of business on August 23,
    1956; and that each other government which accepts membership
    by December 31, 1956, should be called upon to make payment
    within 30 days of the date on which it becomes a member. Calls
    have been made accordingly.
         As of September 15, all member countries whose payments
    are due, except Bolivia, Egypt and Peru, have paid their sub
    scriptions in full. These payments, which aggregate $77,520,000,
    were all made in United States dollars. The funds received have
    been invested in U. S. Government obligations with maturities
    of up to five years.


    OPERA TING POLICIES

    The Board of Directors has adopted a Statement of Operating
    Policies for the initial stage of the Corporation's operations,
    supplementing the operational principles set forth in the Articles
    of Agreement. The policies so adopted will be reviewed from time
    to time in the light of experience.
         The Statement of Operating Policies has been elaborated
    into a booklet prepared for public distribution, giving general
    4




.   ,
infonnation as to the manner in which the Corporation operates,
the scope of its activities and the criteria which an investment
proposal must satisfy to be of interest to the Corporation. The
booklet is available in French, German and Spanish as well as in
English. Copies are being distributed to the Governors.



ACTIVITIES OF THE CORPORATION

An encouraging degree of interest in the Corporation's activities
has been evidenced by private industrial enterprises and private
investors all over the world. The inquiries received include a
number of proposals which appear to be of a kind appropriate for
Corporation investment and in these cases the sponsors have been
asked to present detailed infonnation. The inquiries cover a wide
variety of ventures in many different fields; and even within the
field of industry, upon which the Corporation is concentrating,
projects as diverse as the mining and refining of primary ores and
the production of insecticides have been presented. Financing has
been sought for enterprises located in almost every important
less developed area, although more proposals have related to
investment in Latin America than in any other region.
      In addition to preliminary investigation and discussion of
the investment proposals received, officials of the Corporation
have been actively engaged in establishing liaison with private
investment markets, both in the United States and abroad.
During April and May, in the course of a staff recruitment trip,
a series of meetings was arranged with private bankers and
officers of investment institutions in Belgium, England, France,
Gennany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland, to acquaint
them with the Corporation's objectives and to enlist their support
and interest as possible future partners. It is contemplated that
similar efforts will be made periodically in both the capital
exporting and the less developed countries.

                                                                5
STAFF

It has been thought desirable, in the interests of economy and to
avoid duplication of effort, that to the greatest extent practicable
the Corporation should make use of Bank staff and services. The
Corporation will not, therefore, have its own service depart
ments, but will call upon the Bank's Legal, Treasurer's and
Administration Departments, its Offices of the Secretary and
Information and its Economic Staff, as needed from time to
time. The Corporation and the Bank have entered into an agree
ment wh~reby each will reimburse the other for the cost of the
facilities, personnel and services provided to it by the other.
      Apart from its management, the Corporation's own staff
will consist, for the time being, of an Engineering Adviser, with
one assistant, and of a small group of financial officers, initially
under ten in number. This staff, aided by outside consultants who
may be called upon from time to time, will be primarily re
sponsible for analyzing investment proposals presented to the
Corporation and negotiating, or assisting the management in
negotiating, investment terms.
      Dr. \V. J. Jenkins, retired Chairman of the Nobel Division
of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, has been appointed
Engineering Adviser. In addition, eight operations officers, of six
different nationalities, have been appointed. These operations
officers will not, for the time being, be assigned particular geo
graphic or functional responsibilities and will all report directly
to the management. It is intended to delay more formal organi
zation of the staff until after more experience has been gained
of the nature and volume of the Corporation's work.
      Arrangements have been made to extend to the Corpora
tion's staff the benefits of the Bank's retirement plan.

A summary balance sheet of the Corporation (unaudited), as of
September 15, 1956, is attached as Appendix D.


STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET

As of July 24, 1956, the Bank had incurred expenses in con
nection with the organization of the Corporation amounting to
$32,449.53. Pursuant to authorization of the Board of Directors
the Corporation has reimbursed the Bank in that amount. No
formal and detailed budget has as yet been presented to the
Directors, in view of the difficulty of forecasting with any reason
able degree of accuracy the probable scope of the Corporation's
activities during its first months of operation or the rate at which
its staff will grow. It is estimated, however, that expenses of the
Corporation from July 24 to December 31, 1956, will not exceed
$300,000, including both direct expenses of the Corporation and
the amount of any further reimbursement by the Corporation to
the Bank for the cost of services and personnel furnished by the
Bank. The Directors have accordingly approved the expenditure
of up to $300,000 for the remainder of the calendar year, pending
adoption of a formal budget. Before December 31, 1956, the
management will submit for the approval of the Directors an
administrative budget for the remainder of the current fiscal year.
