assistance and for managing for results that is being imple-
mented in 5 countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Uganda, and Vietnam). Good progress is being made in 10 ad-
ditional countries, and elements of the agenda are being im-
plemented, though less systematically, in 40 more.
   During fiscal 2006, the Bank participated in international
efforts to establish a plan for monitoring implementation of
the Paris Declaration's 56 detailed commitments. An effort
to establish a baseline for the agreed-on indicators was
launched in May 2006, the first-ever opportunity for a simulta-
neous study and coordination of aid in a large number of
countries. Impediments to broader progress remain, however,
even in countries where governments and donors are working
on the agenda. These impediments include inadequate data,
inappropriate staff incentives (in donor agencies and govern-
ments), institutional rigidities, poor communication, and in-
sufficient institutional leadership in some donor agencies.

TWOPILLARSOFTHEBANK'SANTIPOVERTYSTRATEGY
Improving the investment climate and empowering people are
the two pillars of the Bank's long-term antipoverty strategy.
The pillars intertwine, with progress in human development
providing the capacity to sustain improvements in the invest-
ment climate, support economic growth, and address eco-
nomic and social inequality.

Pillar1:ImprovingtheInvestmentClimate
The Bank fosters economic growth through advocacy for more
equitable trade, support for policy reform, and project-specific
investments in trade, private sector initiatives, infrastructure,
the financial sector, and extractive industries, often in part-
nership with other Bank Group institutions.

Increasing Support for Infrastructure In fiscal 2006 there
were 125 new projects approved with an infrastructure com-
ponent; these totaled more than $8 billion. This increase of
approximately 10 percent over the previous fiscal year is in
line with the Bank's Infrastructure Action Plan, developed in
2003 to respond more robustly to client requests involving
both infrastructure investment needs and broader develop-
ment objectives as outlined in the MDGs. Most of the com-
mitments were in the transportation sector (40 percent) and
the energy and mining sector (38 percent), followed by the
water, sanitation, and flood protection sector (21 percent).
Project quality has remained consistently high since the
plan's inception, and the proportion of projects at risk con-
tinues to be lower than the Bank average.
   In addition, the Bank delivered 139 analytic and advisory
products related to infrastructure, one of which was a major
study of lessons learned, Infrastructure at the Crossroads:
Lessons from 20 Years of World Bank Experience. At the G-8's
Gleneagles Summit, the Bank was asked to assume global
leadership in two infrastructure-related areas: ensuring suc-
cessful coordination of the sizable increase in aid provided in
support of the infrastructure agenda in Africa; and creating a
new framework for mobilizing investment in clean energy and
development. (See "Responding to Climate Change" on page

  the Bank to better understand, work more closely with, and

provide microfinance and self-employment opportunities to
millions of poor women. In Afghanistan, the Bank approved a

Inequality: Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union;
Enhancing Job Opportunities: Eastern Europe and the Former

the ways poverty hampers achievement of high and sustained
growth rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. The report
recommends packages of policies to convert vicious circles of
low growth and high poverty into virtuous circles in which
poverty reduction and high growth reinforce each other.

BUILDING THE CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT
The Bank is helping governments throughout the region
improve the investment climate. For example, a $300 million
loan to Mexico is helping small businesses participate in the
formal market and improve competitiveness. A $250 million
loan to Colombia is facilitating the creation and operation of
businesses and improving access to finance. Perhaps most
important, the Bank is helping governments address their
development priorities through a series of development loans.
These loans are intended to boost growth, reduce poverty,
improve social indicators, reinforce macroeconomic stability,
and increase the efficiency of the public sector. For example,
El Salvador and Guatemala have received loans of $100
million, each under this program.

IBRDResources
IBRD obtains most of its funds by selling bonds in interna-
tional capital markets. In fiscal 2006, it raised $10 billion at
medium- to long-term maturities, lower than the $13 billion
raised in fiscal 2005. Debt securities, with a wide range of
maturities and structures, were issued in 11 currencies.
   IBRD is able to borrow high volumes for long maturities on
very favorable terms. IBRD's financial strength is based on its
prudent financial policies and practices, which help it main-
tain its high credit rating.

profit but to earn enough income to ensure its financial

Harmonizing and aligning donor assistance occurs at the
country level through, for example, participation in joint
analytic work, collaborative preparation of country and sector
strategies, and development of common arrangements to
finance projects and programs. The Bank made further
progress with other donors on this agenda by signing a
Financial Management Framework Agreement with the
United Nations in March 2006. This agreement represents a
significant milestone in the Bank's ongoing program of finan-
cial management harmonization, which had, until now,
focused on bilateral and multilateral development agencies.
This new agreement allows the Bank to rely on the UN's
financial management regulations within a framework that
continues to provide the Bank with reasonable assurance that
its funds will be used for the intended purposes.
