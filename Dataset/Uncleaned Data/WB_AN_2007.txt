The World Bank today operates out of more than 100 offices
worldwide. Increased presence in client countries is helping
the Bank to better understand, work more closely with, and
provide faster service to clients. Three-fourths of outstanding
loans are managed by country directors located away from the
Bank's Washington, DC, headquarters. Thirty-three percent of staff
are now based in country offices.
