The economy of the Republic of Korea, the venue of
the 1985 Annual Meetings of the World Bank and In-
ternational Monetary Fund, continued to be buoyant
in 1984. Gross national product increased by almost 8
percent, the current-account deficit held at 2 percent,
and inflation slowed to 3 percent. The photo shows a

of $11,086 million, or $1,255 million over bor-

refinancings of short-term borrowings that were
outstanding at the end of fiscal 1984-some
$2,000 million in discount notes and $749 mil-

9 percent. After taking into account currency-

to as currency swaps-which changed the "ef-

NOTE: Debt-service ratios are based on debt service actually paid and not on contractual service due. Information on the sources, definitions, coverage, and
interpretation of the data is given in the "General Notes to Appendix Tables."
a. Because of special monetary arrangements, peculiar to countries such as this, the debt-service ratio must be regarded with more than usual caution in
considering the country's external financial situation.
b. Includes a notional share of debt-service payments on loans to the East African community: Kenya-42%: Tanzania-32hh; and Uganda-26%.
c. Service payments for these years reflect the result of rescheduling arrangements.
d. Service payments for these years are affected strongly by prepayments.
e. Debt data are for fiscal years.
na. Not available.

President and Board of Governors,
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through G present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development at June 30, 1985 and 1984, and the results of its operations and the changes in its
financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such
other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

a. The Association's resources available for commitment have been increased by the amount of the accumulated loss for the period July 1, 1979 through
December 31, 1984, in accordance with the decision of the Executive Directors that the Association's commitment authority not be reduced by the amount ot
deficits during the sixth replenishment period. The Association is currently reviewing how deficits incurred thereafter are to be treated.
b. Includes twenty-two development credits totaling $665,155,000 approved by the Association subject to the availability of additional commitment authority. At
June 30, 1985, the amount of $368,756,000 of additional resources has become available lor commitment and is included herein but has not been allocated to
specitic development credits, as a result, the aggregate amount of development credits subject to availability of commitment authority has decreased to
$296,399,000. The difference of $753,277,000 between this amount and $1,049,676,000 is primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations in the value, in
terms of current US dollars, of resources expressed in other member currencies and provided in prior fiscal years. The value of these resources at any given
time may be greater or less than the development credits committed against them, since these development credits are denominated in US dollars or special
drawing rights.

July 29, 1985
President and Board of Governors,
International Development Association
We have examined the financial statements of the International Development Association appearing in
Appendices A through F. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with gener-
ally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such
other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
As described in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the notes to the
financial statements, no decision has been made as to the standard of value to be substituted for the
1960 dollar in determining the repayment obligations of certain of the Association's development
credits. Pending a decision on this matter, the financial statements have been presented using $1.20635
as the standard of value in measuring these development credit repayment obligations. The amount of
any adjustment that might be required as a result of a decision on the standard of value cannot be
determined.
In our opinion, subject to the effects on the financial statements of such adjustments, if any, as might
have been required had the outcome of the uncertainty referred to in the preceding paragraph been
known, the financial statements examined by us present fairly, in terms of United States dollars, the
financial position of the International Development Association at June 30, 1985 and 1984, the results
of its operations and the changes in its resources available for commitment for the years then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

President and Board of Governors,
Special Fund Administered by the
International Development Association
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through E present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, the financial position of the Special Fund Administered by the International
Development Association at June 30, 1985 and 1984, and the results of its operations and the changes
in its resources available for commitment for the years then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the
accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.
