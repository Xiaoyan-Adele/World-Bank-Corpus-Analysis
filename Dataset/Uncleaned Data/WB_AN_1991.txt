Cover:
An Aka girl washing her hands after coming back
with her family from working in the fields near
Chiang Rai in northern Thailand. It is an Aka
tradition that girls work in the fields. In the old days,
opium was the main cash crop; more recently, with
assistance provided by both the Thai royal family
and the Bank, farmers have switched to corn, vege-
tables, and flowers.

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 188 through 205 of this Report present fairly, in
all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development at June 30, 1991 and 1990. and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States and with International Accounting Standards. These financial statements are the responsibility of
management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International Auditing Guidelines, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 208 through 218 of this Report present fairly, in
all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Development
Association, the Special Fund Administered by the International Development Association, and the Debt
Reduction Facility for IDA-Only Countries Administered by the International Development Association at
June 30, 1991 and 1990, and the changes in their accumulated surplus and grants and their cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and with
International Accounting Standards. These financial statements are the responsibility of management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International
Auditing Guidelines, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
