a. Bank lending amounts in fiscal 1998 and 1999 are presented together, the two years being exceptional due to the East Asian financial crisis.
b. Due to a recoding of one project there is a discrepancy between these figures and the figures in the 2002 annual report (table 2.2). This discrepancy
of 2.2 million shows up in the commitment amounts in fiscal 2002 for Social Protection and Risk Management and Rural Development (with the two
themes showing 2.2 million higher and 2.2 million lower, respectively).

    poverty in these countries continues to be founded

GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM

Considerable research and country experience have
shown that good governance, development, and
poverty reduction are fundamentally linked. An
increasingly important area of the Bank's work,
approximately $2.5 billion in loan commitments in
fiscal 2003 promote governance and public sector
reform. The Bank's strategy for governance and public

Investing in People



The challenge of reducing global poverty and improv-
ing the human welfare of millions of poor people
could scarcely be more powerful. In 2002 almost
11 million children died before their fifth birthday.
Most of these deaths occurred in developing countries,
with 4.5 million in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, and
many others in South Asia. Maternal mortality is
20 times higher among the poorest quarter of the
world's population than among the richest quarter.
In 2002, 3.1 million people died from HIV/AIDS. Life
expectancy has fallen by as much as 20 years in those
countries with the highest infection rates, and hard-
won improvements in child mortality have been
reversed. Some 115 million primary-school-age
children in developing countries do not go to school;
64 million of them are girls.
   The World Bank stands by its commitment to scale
up efforts to help countries achieve universal primary
education, combat communicable diseases, reduce
child mortality, improve maternal health, and protect
vulnerable populations from crisis.

Toward Environmentally and Socially
Responsible Growth


During fiscal 2003 the World Bank has been advocating
for the vision of responsible growth that was put forth
in the World Development Report 2003 and affirmed at
the World Summit on Sustainable Development
(WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in August
2002.
   At the summit a consensus emerged on moving
toward a new development path that will combine
growth with environmental responsibility and social
equity, in both rich and poor countries. Poverty
reduction is much more than a development aid
issue--it is also an issue of global stability, the
summit emphasized.
   One key message emerging from Johannesburg and
the Bank's own operational experience is clear: enlight-
ened public policy, a responsible and accountable pri-

are needed to achieve the WSSD targets and the Mil-        The world community is making renewed commitments to urgently need-

Supporting Private Sector Development

The World Bank's Private Sector Development and
Infrastructure Networks promote private initiatives
for poverty reduction and support infrastructure
development in poor countries. Two separate vice
presidencies were created from the former Private
Sector Development and Infrastructure Vice
Presidency in fiscal 2003. The Infrastructure Vice
Presidency, which now consolidates the Bank's infra-
structure departments and infrastructure-related
global programs, commenced operations as a
separate network in May 2003. So also did the new

     Building Strong Financial Systems



     The World Bank has long recognized that poverty
     reduction and economic growth depend on effective
     and strong national financial systems. Financial sys-
     tems that develop unevenly and lack transparency and
     proper regulation are more vulnerable to financial
     shocks and prone to distress. Extensive Bank research
     has proven that these shocks and crises disproportion-
     ately affect poor people. Weak financial systems in
     developing countries also exacerbate poverty levels by
     providing inadequate access to capital and financial
     services to individuals and to small and medium enter-
     prises, which are key to economic growth. The Bank
     contributes to these financial sector priorities in three
     ways: knowledge dissemination, lending and technical
     assistance, and partnerships.

with fragile financial systems. In response, the Bank
intensified its work in this area, establishing a strong,
systematic program to help client countries build
institutional capacity. Since September 2001 the
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
have completed, initiated, or agreed to deliver 52
technical assistance programs to 40 countries and

assistance projects involved advice or assistance in

proportion involving laws to combat terrorist

DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES

Developing human capital is key to reducing poverty
through better access to education and health services
and through social protection interventions to help
vulnerable groups. In fiscal 2003 over 21 percent
($811 million) of the Bank's commitments in Africa
were for human development. Communicable dis-
eases, notably HIV/AIDS, pose critical challenges for
Africa's development. The Bank has approved $1 bil-
lion over time to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa and remains
the region's leading financier of HIV/AIDS programs.
Through the Multicountry HIV/AIDS Program for
Africa, $600 million has been committed by 20 coun-
tries. This program has approved 18 projects, of which
15 are already effective. Other health, nutrition, and
population programs involved 47 projects in 30 coun-
tries. (See box 5.1.)
   The Bank is actively involved in 41 education
projects in the region, particularly focusing on pri-
mary education and on countries with low enroll-
ments. Commitments in fiscal 2003 were $423.6 mil-         Road transportation is now the dominant form of transportation in the

priority, especially for girls, not only because of its    the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF).

help households manage social risks, build an effective
social policy framework, and enable poor people to
participate in the benefits of growth. A key point of
its strategy in low-income countries is assisting the
government in developing a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP)--a country-owned frame-
work of macroeconomic, structural, and social poli-

     The Bank integrates environmental components into
     much of its lending in rural, urban, water, and energy
     sectors. Furthermore, the Bank has forestry manage-
     ment programs under way in Cambodia, China,
     Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and

In its financing and technical assistance in the water
sector, the Bank uses a variety of approaches involv-
ing both public and private sector investments to
expand water and sanitation service to poor people.
These approaches include a $50 million project to
expand water service to 1.3 million people in rural
Peru, as well as financing to rehabilitate water sup-
ply and sanitation networks and wells, promote
water conservation, and improve efficiency and
service at Lima's public water utility. The project also
expanded service to 600,000 previously unserved
slum dwellers.

the MDGs by 2015 will require new investment in
health and basic education as well as infrastructure.

GLOBAL PRIORITIES

The Middle East and North Africa region focused ac-
tivities on the following global priorities during this
fiscal year.


Maternal and Child Health
With children and youth constituting more than half
of the population in the Middle East and North Africa
region, they are among the most vulnerable segments
of society during times of economic stress and political
conflict. In coordination with the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other partners, the
Bank is conducting situation analyses and supporting
community-based projects to deliver services for

NA Precise figures are not available.
a. World Bank Atlas methodology; per capita GNI (gross national income, formerly GNP) figures are in 2002 U.S. dollars.
b. Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness. The operational cutoff for IDA eligibility for fiscal 2004 is a
2002 GNI per capita of $865, using Atlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries must also meet tests of performance. In exceptional circumstances, IDA
extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD
lending. An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote c).
c. An exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($865 for fiscal 2004) has been made for some small island economies, which
otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness. For such countries IDA funding is considered case by case
for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness.
d. Loans/credits in nonaccrual status as of June 30, 2003.

Note: Countries choose whether they are Part I or Part II based primarily on economic standing. Part I countries are almost all donors to the International
Development Association and they pay their contributions in freely convertible currency. Part II countries may be donors and are entitled to pay most of
their contributions in local currency. For more information, and for Statement of Voting Power, and Subscriptions and Contributions of IDA Members,
