A population project in Egypt, for which IDA

the third such project in the regionj to be as-
sisted by the Bank Group. The earlier ones were
in Iran and Tunisia. Egypt's population has been
growing rapidly, by about 2.5% per year; and
this has led to a population density of about
2,500 persons per square mile of habitable
land (which is only 3.5% of its territory). At the
current population growth rate, Egypt would

which the internal and external auditors may

Economic Research and Studies
The Executive IDirectors conducted a detailed
review of the Bank's research program during
the year. Although considerable progress has
been made in organizing the program, they
agreed that further efforts are necessary to
improve the dissemination of research results;
to expand collaboration with research workers
and research institutes in developing countries;    '11
and to improve the international exchange of
information on research priorities and the co-
ordination of work in progress.
The Executive Directors noted that the Bank
is broadening the areas of its concern to) in-
clude such fields as population, rural develop-
ment, income distribution, urbanization and
employment. In these fields, data are scarce
and the formulation of policy measures and
action programs is hampered by lack of knowl-
edge. The Bank seeks to limit itself to research
in which it has a comparative advantage, and
to avoid duplicating the work of others. The    Time for class at a Malaysian school. In April the
