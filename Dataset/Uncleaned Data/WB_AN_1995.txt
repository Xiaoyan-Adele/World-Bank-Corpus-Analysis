This Annutlal Report, which covers the period July 1, 1 994, to June 30, 1995, has been prepared by
the executive directors of both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) anid
the International Development Associationi (IDA) in accordanice with the respective by-laws of the two
institutions. lames D. Wolfensohn, president of the IBRD and IDA and chairman of the boards of execu-
tive directors, has submitted this Report, together with accompanying administrative budgets and
audited finanicial statements, to the board of governors.
The executive directors would like to take this opportunity to render tribute to Lewis T Preston
and express appreciation for the outstanding leadership he provided to the World Bank Group from
September 1, 1991 until his untimely death on May 4, 1995. During that period the Bank's member-
ship became nearly universal, and the challenges facinig the Bank Group were greater than ever. They
acknowledge in particular Mr. Preston's role in reemphasizinig the reduction of poverty in the develop-
ing world as the Bank's central objective, in promoting investment in people, in enhancinig the quality
of the Bank Group's assistance to its member counitries, in developing partnerships with the public and
private sectors, and in making the Bank a more open, flexible institution, better equipped to respond to
the vast challenges its diverse membership will face in the years to come.
Annual reports for the International Finanice Corporation (lFC), the Multilateral Guaranitee Agency
(N11G.A), and the Interniational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (IwsIm) are published
separately.

is to assist the economic developimienit of devel-

althoughl there is not yet a formal, comprehensive
policy other thian the view that the Bank should
complemenit, not displace or compete with, the
private sector. Efficiency and accountability
themes permeate this policy area also, particularly
since the IF( still has the most private sector expe-
rience in the Bank Group. Closer coordination
and inforniationi-shar-ing among the Bank, the 1C,
and MiiGA have heen outgrowths of the emphasis
on the private sector
Another outgrowth of both the private sector-
emphasis and the desire for more efficienicy was
the decision to mainistream Bank guaranitees as
an operational tool. Again, several years of ex-
perience withi a pilot program helped achieve
conisenisus among the executive directorl-s on a
dramatic departure from xvhat had been Bank
policy for half a ceitury. Although the Articles
of Agreement menitioni guarantees, the\ have
been used only sporadically and have never
foUnd a widespread role in Banik operations. In
fiscal 1 995, however, the board agreed that the
Bank's guarantee could be used muchI mor-e,
given a numbeL-  of conditionis, to attratA private
capital ancl the private sector, particularly to
large infrastrlucture projects. Since the EL and
ic(;,\ are also involved in guarantees, directors
stressed the need for carefLil coor-diniation antd
collahoration among the parts of the Bank
Group, as well as with bilateral export cr-edit
agencies.
Appointing a New President
In March 1 995 the executive directors unani-
mously appointed James D. Wolfensohn to be-
come the Bank's ninth president. He wvas ap-
pointed for a term of five years that began on
June 1, 1995.
