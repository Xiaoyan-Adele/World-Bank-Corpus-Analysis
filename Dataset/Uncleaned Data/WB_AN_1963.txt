T11E RATE OF NEWNV COMMITMENTS BY 'TIIE INTERNAIIONAL DDEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
continued to rise during the year, the third of IDA's existence. New credits for projects
in the less developed countries amounted to $260 million, as against $101 million in
IDA's first year and $134 million in its second. IDA's uncommitted resources of con-
vertible currencies declined correspondingly. TI'lhe Articles of Agreement provide proce-
dures for keeping the adequacy of IDA's resources under review, and steps are now being
taken toward replenishlinlg these resources.
The aims of the Association are, in the words of its Articles of Agreement, "to pro-
mote economic devclopmnenlt, increase productivity and thus raise standards of living in
the less developed areas of the world." Like the World Bank, of which it is an affiliate,
IDA works toward this end by lhelping to finance carefully selected and prepared devel-
opmelnt projects. However, IDA's financial resources are entirely separate from those of
the Bank, and it providcs capital on much more liberal terms of repayment. Tlhese
teris make it possible for the Association to assist less developed countries whose ability
to make good use of capital exceeds their capacity to service loans extended on con-
ventionial terms.
All the development credits so far extended bv IDA have been repayable in foreign
exchanige over 50 vears, free of interest. In each case, there is a ten-year period of grace,
followilng Nv]liCl 1% per anlum is repayable over the next ten years, and 30%, in each of
the final 30 years. 'TIo help to meet IDA's adminiistrative costs, a service charge of 3/4 of
1% per annlum is payable on amounts withdrawn and outstanding.



Under the Articles of Agreement, members of the Association are divided into two
groups: Part I countries, consisting of the countries that are more advaniced economi-
cally; and Part II countries, comprising the less developed nations. The initial subscrip-
tiolns of Part I countries are payable entirely in freely convertible funds. Part II countries
pay onlv 10% of their initial subscriptions in convertible funds; the remainder is paid in
the member's own currencv and mav not be used bv IDA without the member's consent.
The initial subscriptions to IDA by its member countries included approximatcly
$765 million equivalent in freely convertible funds, to be paid over a five-vear period and
to be available for commitment by IDA in its first five years of operations. This amount
has since been incrcased by two welcome supplementary contributionls by Sweden, total-
ing $10 million cquivalent, raising the total available to about $775 million cquivalcnt.
At June 30, 1963, $495 million had been committed in development credits, leaving a
balance of about $280 million. In fact the amount available for fresh commitmenits is
considerably less than this balance. In meetings of the Consortinm on Aid to Pakistan,
relating to the fiscal year 1962/63, indications were given, subject to action by the
Executive Directors, that an additional $102.5 million of IDA's initial resources would
be available to finance suitable projects in Pakistan, but the credits had not been finally
negotiatcd by the end of the fiscal year. On the other hand, IDA lcnding to India by
June 30, 1963, included $15 million which should be attributed to IDA's fiscal year
1963/64. The net effect of these two adjustments was to reduce the available resources
of IDA by the end of the fiscal year to about $193 million.
It is clear that for a considerable period IDA cannot look for any substantial
replenishment of its resources from repayment of its credits. Continuation of its lending
operations is thus dependent upon fresh contributionis from time to time from member
countries.
At the Annual Meeting held in September 1962, IDA's Board of Governors asked
the Executive Directors to consider the prospective financial requirements of the Asso-
ciation and to prepare a report. The Executive Directors have reported to the Board
of Governors that on the basis of projects under active consideration, the uncommitted
balance of the Association's initial resources in freely usable currencies as of June 30,
1963, was likely to support new commitments for onlv about six to nine months. The
Executive Directors reached the conclusion that it was desirable to provide the Associa-
tion with additional resources to enable it to continue operations and that there was
ample justification for providing increased resources to the Association. Their report
further states that Part I countries, together with Belgium and Luxembourg, which
have applied for memberslhip, are prepared, subject to necessary legislative action, to
make available to the Association new resources aggregating $750 million in freely usable
6



currencies, which would be available for commitment for the period up to at least
June 30, 1966. Payment would be made in three annual installments of $250 million
each, the first installment being due in November 1965. Except in the case of Belgium
and Luxembourg, the new resources would take the form of additional contributions
rather than subscriptions and would therefore not carry voting rights. It is proposed
that the contributions of Belgium and Luxembourg each be divided equally between a
subscription and a contribution of additional resources. The proposal submitted by the
Executive Directors further contemplates that the obligation to contribute new resources
should not become binding on any member unless 12 of the prospective contributing
members, whose contributions aggregate at least $600 million, give the Association
formal notification on or before March 1, 1964, that they will contribute the amounts
proposed for each of them.
The table below shows the amounts which would, upon enactment of necessary
legislation, be provided by each contrilbuting govermilent, including in the case of Bel-
gium and Luxembourg, their initial subscriptions:

CREDITS OF THE YEAR
New credits during the fiscal year totaled $260,050,000, made up of 17 credits in
9 countries. In all, IDA has now made development credits totaling $495,150,000 in 18
countries.
In the last fiscal year Asia received by far the majority of the credits, at $203.5
million. Of this amount, India alone accounted for $178 million, the remaining

credits being made to Pakistan and Korea. In Europe, Turkey received three credits,
aggregating $26.7 million. In Africa, Ethiopia and Tunisia received $18.5 million, and in the
Western Hemisphere, El Salvador, Haiti and Nicaragua together received $11.35 million.
Transport was the principal purpose assisted by IDA, at $121 million. Railway loans
in India and Korea accounted for more than half this total. Three credits were made
to assist road construction or maintenance, in El Salvador, Ethiopia and Haiti, and the
remainiing credit for this sector went to assist the improvement of the Port of Bombav
in India.
Power and telecommunications accounted for $81 million. Of this amount, India
received three credits which accounted for almost all the total. The other power credit
was of $1.7 million to Turkey.
Irrigation and flood control accounted for $38 million in credits to India, Pakistan
and Turkev. Industry was assisted by two credits totaling $11.5 million, one for indus-
trial estates in Pakistan and the other to assist in the lending program of the Turkish
Industrial Development Bank.
The remaining credits of the year totaled $8 million and were for social investment
projects. Nicaragua received $3 million to improve drinking water supplies in the capital



city of Managua, and Tunisia received the first credit made by IDA to assist the con-
struction of schools.
Short accounts of the year's new credits are given in the country-by-country summary
later in this Report.
MEMBERSHIP AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
The membership of IDA increased by 14 countries during the year to a total of 76, and
total subscriptions rose to the equivalent of $968.75 million by June 30, 1963. With the
exception of Kuwait, which will pay its entire subscription in convertible currencies,

all the new members were in the Part II category of membership. Payments on sub-
scriptions by all members during the fiscal year totaled $208 million.
In addition, Sweden made a special supplementary contributioni to IDA's resources
of Skr.22,053,524 ($4,263,000). The funds will be made available to IDA in freely con-
vertible Swedish kronor, neither tied to procurement in Sweden nor restricted to use in
any specificd countries or in any specified projects.
T'his contribution raises Sweden's participation in the financing of IDA to double
the amount of its initial subscription. A year ago Sweden made a supplementary con-
tribution equivalent to $5,827,000 in kronor on terms similar to the new contribution.
These supplementary contributions, together with its initial subscription of $10,090,000,
make Sweden's total contribution to IDA the equivalent of $20,180,000.

A N N E X               lThe information in this section describes credits made by
IDA during the fiscal year 1962/63. All these credits were on
identical terms, as follows:
No repayments for the first 10 years, then 1% repayment per
annum for the next ten years, then 3%70 per annum for the next
30 years. The Credits are free of interest, but a service charge of
3æ4 of 1% per annum is pèayable on the amounts withdrawn and
outstanding, to meet the administrative costs of IDA.
Africa
ETHIOPIA
HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENIT                 $13.5 mnillion credit signed Februar) 27, 1963
The improvement of Ethiopia's highway network, begun in 1950 with World Bank
assistance, has already contributed significantly to the development of the economy.
Better roads have reduced travel time and transporticosts to a fractioni of their former
level; have opened new areas to production, making possible an increase in the output of
various crops both for export and for home markets; and have induced a shift from
subsistence to cash crop agriculture.
Thle IDA credit will assist a new phase of the highway program bv providing the
foreign exchange needed to complete the new roads now under construction and to
build two new roads with a total lengtlh of 135 miles. It will also be used to import
accounting machines for the Imperial Highway Authority and to pay the costs of foreign
consultants who are assisting the Authority in organizational and engineering matters,
and conducting a survev and feasibilitv study of a proposed new road through the
Awash Valley to the new port of Assab.
TUNISIA
SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION                   $5 mnillion7 credit signed September 17, 1962
Tunisia's development planning lays great stress on education; the country has few
natural resources and improvement of the living standards of the four million inhabit-
ants is particularly dependent on the development of human skills to form the basis for
more productive agriculture and the expansion of industry and services. During the next
three years the Government intends to spend $31 million equivalent on the expansion
10



of secondary and middle education and the IDA credit will help to meet this cost,
providing just over half the financinig for the construction and equipment of six schools
for which there is particularly urgent need. In Tunis, the credit will finance the exten-
sion of a teachers' training college, a secondary school emphasizinig mathematics and
techlical courses, and a new secondary school for girls. In Sfax, the second largest city
of Tunisia, it will finance expansion of the Technical School. The remainder of the
credit will be used to build two large middle schools in the provinces.
The credit was the first made by IDA for school construction, and also the first
operation in Tunisia by either IDA or the Bank.
Asia and the Middle East
I N D I A
IRRIGATION-1'URNA        PROJECT            $13 m7tillion credit signed Jully 18, 1962
T'he credit will help to complete an irrigation project to supply 152,000 acres in the
Purna River Valley in the State of Maharashtra, and to provide a 15,000-kilowatt hydro-
electric power station. The Puma project will introduce irrigated agriculture to a
drought-strickeni area in the wvestern part of the Indian high plateau. The resulting
higher yields in crops are expected to increase the value of production about sixfold.
'l'he project includes the constructioni of two dams on the Purna River, a 50-mile main
canal and about 250 miles of distribution canals with associated works. Provision is
made for a water managemenit program, to be carefully administered with the help of a
consultant, to avoid dangers of water-logging and salinity. In addition, the State will
provide services to farmers in the project area to improve farming practices and to meet
their requirements for fertilizer and for agricultural credit.
Thle Government of India customarily finances 60%  of the cost of irrigation
schemes of this type and the IDA credit will be part of this contributioni, which is made
available to the State of Mlaharaslitra in the form of interest-bearing advances repayable
in 7 to 15 annual installments, with an appropriate grace period, at 4% per annum.
POWER-KOYNA PROJECT                      S17.5 million credit signied Auguist 8, 1962
A \NVorld Bank loan of $18.7 millioni, made in 1959, assisted constructioni of the
first stage of the Kovlna hydroelectric project, wvhiclh is now coming into operation with
installed capacity of 240,000 kilowatts. This new credit will help to finanice the second
stage of the project, increasinig its capacity to 580,000 kilowatts. T'he Government of



India is finanicing the entire cost of the project through annual advances and in this
case also the IDA credit will form part of the Government's contribution, whiclh is
repavable bv the State of Maharashtra over 20 years, after a ten-year period of grace, at
an interest rate determined annually and now standing at 41/2%  per annum. At the
completion of Stage 11, the Koyna project, one of the largest hydroelectric undertakings
in India, will nearly double the capacity of the electricity system serving the highlv
industrialized Bombav-Poona area. Stage I of the Kovna project included the construc-
tion of the storage dam, the tunnel system, the underground powerhouse and associated
transmission facilities. Stage 11 includes raising the dam to its design heighlt of 280 feet
above the river bed; the installationi of four 75,000-kilowatt units to complete the power
station; the construction of a second 40,000-kilowatt power station at the foot of the
dam; strengthening the transmission system to Bombay; and construction of transmis-
sion lines to the site of a new aluminum factory to be built on the west coast 45 miles
from Koyna.
PORT   OF BOMBAY                       $18 m7lillioni credit signied September 14, 1962
The credit will assist a five-year program to expand facilities at the Port of Bombay
for both cargo and passenger traffic. The Indian Government will make available the
equivalent of the credit to the Trustees of the Port of Bombay either through long-term
loans or outright sales of foreign exchanige. Cargo traffic through Bombay has doubled
in the past ten vears to a total of about 15 million tons. Passenger traffic has also risen
as long-distance passenger liners and cruise ships have called at the port in increasing
numbers in recent years. Tlhc increased traffic has put a great strain on port facilities,
particularly those for handlinig the larger cargo vesscls.
The expansioni program, based on the recommendationis of consultants, includes the
construction of four additional deep-water berthls at Alexandra Dock; a new ferry wharf
adjacent to Prince's Dock so as to release three harbor-wall berths for deep-water berth-
ing; an extension of Ballard Pier to provide an additional bertlh and a new building
equipped to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic; dredging of the main harbor
channel; new floating craft, including a new drag-suction dredge, two grab dredges,
seven tugs, four harbor launches and one salvage-cum-nwater boat; and improved port
equipment and services.
TEL E CO AM M UN I CA 7' IONS         $42 million credit signed September 14, 1962
The Indian Post and Tclegraphs Departmcnt will use the IDA funds for the pur-
chase abroad over the next twvo vears of equipmenit to expand and improve telephone
12



and telegraph services. India has only about 1.2 telephones per 1,000 inhabitants, com-
pared with an average of 5 per 1,000 for Asia, 46 for the entire world and 300 to 400
for most higlhly developed countries. The backlog of registered applications for new
subscribcr services amounts to some 50% of those installed and even this percentage
may understate the effective demand.
The telegraph svstem is equally unable to cope with demand. Most telegraph offices
in India are still equipped with Morse Code sounders, hand-operated at 25 words per
minute, as against the interniationial speed of 66 words per minute by mechanical
processes.
Accordingly, the Indian Thlird Five-Year Plan aims at increasing telephone sub-
scriber sets from 461,000 to 761,000 between 1961 and 1965 and raising the capacity of
the central exchaniges from 412,600 to 758,100 lines. The telegraph service will be
improved bv building new telegraph offices, installing telecommunications equipment
operating at the international speed and considerably expanding the teleprinter service.
The total investment involved is estimated at the equivalent of $280 million, of which
$100 million is required in foreign currencies. The IDA credit will contribute to this
requiremenit.
R A I LW A Y S                          $67.5 777illionl credit signied March1 22, 1963
India's railway system, one of the world's largest and most successful, is the coun-
try's most important carrier of long-distance freight and passenger traffic. Its con-
tinuing expansion and modernization is central to India's development plans. Under
both the Second Five-Year Plan (1955-61) and the current Third Plan (1961-66), the
Railways account for about one-fifth of all investments in the public sector. In par-
ticular, the foreign exchange cost of the Railway's developmelnt program has been sub-
stantial. Considerable help in meeting it has been provided by World Bank loans
totaling $378 million since 1957-by far the largest amount the Bank has lent for any
single enterprise.
The foreign exchaiige cost of the 1961-66 program is expected to reach the equiv-
alent of Rs.2,490 million ($523 million), despite the fact that India, bv developing local
manufacture of railway equipmenit, has somewhat reduced its dependence on1 imports;
electric locomotives, for instance, are nlow built by the Indiani Railways, and by 1966
most of the locomotives needed will be locally produced.
The IDA credit will help the Indiani Railways to finance planned imports of track,
materials, componenits and equipment needed during 1963 to build locomotives and
rolling stock in India, and also to finance imports needed for the electrification program
and various other items required to increase carrying capacity.

POWER-KOTHACUDEM            PROJEC CT        $20 itllion credit signed May 24, 1963
This credit will assist colistruction of a 120,000-kilowatt thermoelectric power sta-
tion near Kothaguldem, in the center of the large Singareni coal fields in the northern
part of the State of Andhra Pradesh. A reservoir will also be built to supplv cooling
water, and a 150-mile transm1ission line will be constructed to connect with other power
facilities. The project is part of a State program to relieve the power shortage which
has for manv vears hampered the development of industry and agriculture. Although
installed generating capacity in Andhra Pradesh was increased from 43,000 to 213,C00
kilowatts during India's first two Five-Year Plans, this was insuffcient to keep up with
demand, which is rising by about 20% each year. The Kotbagudem station has therefore
been designed to allow for further expansion. Over two-tlhirds of the future demand is
expected to comle from industr.
The project will be built and operated by the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity
Board, assisted by consultants during construction. The reservoir will be built by the
State Government. As in the Kovna project, the Government of India is finanlcing the
entire cost of the project througlh annual advances, including the proceeds of the IDA
credit. The State of Andhra Pradesh will repay the advances over a period of 20
years, after a grace period corresponding to the construction period, at interest of 41Ω2%
annuallv. '['he State Government will make part of the proceeds available to the State
Electricity Board on the same repaynment terms, but at 5% aninual interest.
KOREA
RAIL Xv A Y D E  EVL OP MEN               SI $4 milion credit signed August 17, 1962
The proceeds of this credit are being used bv the National Railroad-Korea's prin-
cipal nmcans of transport-for the purclhase abroad of 115 passenger cars and 935 coal
cars, and for the services of foreign consultants to assist in the establishment of a
modern accounting and statistical svstem. Tlhese are among the kev itenis in a five-year
program, 1962-66, to increase capacity and improve efficiencv.
'f'he most scrious problem facing the Railroad has been insufficient equipment for
the movemenlt of coal and for passenger cars. Since 1953 coal production has risen from
less than a million tolns to over five million tons; as a result, whereas Korea spent $25
millioni on coal imports as late as 1956, it is now an exporter of coal. This is bv far the
most important commodity carried bv the Railroad and accounts for almost 50% of
commercial revenuc frecight. Passenger traffic, whichl contributes significantly more to
the Railroad's gross revenues than freight, is also growing. Additional cars are needed to
replace many obsolete passenger cars and 500 converted box cars still in use for pas-
senger service, as well as to provide for future demand.

The Government of Korea is re-lendinig the proceeds of the credit to the Korean
National Railroad for repaymiienlt over a period of approximately 25 vears, begi.ning in
1964, at 53/4% per annum.
PAKISTAN
I ND US TRIAL ESTATES                   S6.5 m77illion credit signied November 2, 1962
Thle development of estates to accommodate small and medium-sized industrial
cnterprises, with the objective of increasing their productive efficiency, is a feature of
Pakistani's Second Five-Year Plan (1960-65). Such enterprises employ about 80% of
Pakistan's industrial workers and account for about 40% of industrial production, and
many of them manufacture items that are produced in higlhly mechanized establish-
menlts in industrializcd countries.
I'i'e IDA credit wvill be used by the West Pakistan Industrial Development Cor-
poration (WPIDC) for the developmert of two industrial estates near Lahore, for
loans for the purchase of machinery and equipment by enterprises settling on the
estates and for the provision of technical and managerial assistance tb estates in other
areas of W\est Pakistan. Each estate will cover about 100 acres and will accommodate
from 300 to 350 enterprises. NVPIDC will provide certain common production facilities,
and assist in obtaininlg credit and raw matcrials and in marketing.
The proceeds of the credit wvill be made available to the Industrial Development
Corporation by the Government of Pakistan througlh the WVest Pakistan Provincial
Governmenit. An estimated $5.3 million, wvhich will be used for capital requirements,
will be repaid by WVPIDC to the Provincial Government over a period of 25 years,
including fivc years of grace, with interest at 4%  a year. The balance of about $1.2
million will be made available bv the Provincial Government to WVPIDC as a grant for
technical assistance facilities and services.
IL O OD CON7'IRPO L                          $5 million credit sign7ed fune 26, 1963
This credit will assist a project to protect about 400,000 acres of cultivated land in
East Pakistan from flooding bv the Teesta and Brahmaputra Rivers. The project should
enable farmers in the area to increase the net value of crop production by the equivalent
of $6 million annually, mainly in rice production, most of which is locally consumed.
An eartheni embankment 135 miles long is to be constructed along the right banks
of the Tcesta and Brahmaputra Rivers. Eight regulators will be installed, two for the
discharge of internial drainage water and six for controlled intake of flood water. The
project also includes the provision of technical assistance and extension services to farm-
115



ers to enable them to obtain the maximum advantage from the flood protection and to
guide them in the establishment of satisfactory cropping and rotation patterns and im-
proved agricultural practices.
The project will be built and operated by the East Pakistan Water and Power
Development Authority. The credit will be re-lent on IDA terms by the Central Govern-
ment of Pakistan to the Province of East Pakistan, which will re-lend an cequivalent
amount to the Authority for repayment over a period of 25 years, including a five-year
grace period, with interest at 4%, a year.

TURKEY
I ND US TRY                           S5 million credit signed November 23, 1962
The Turkish Government will re-lend the proceeds of this credit to the Industrial
Development Bank of Turkev (IDB), which will in turn be enabled to lend foreign
exchange to industrial enterprises in Turlkey WhiChl reTquire imports of equipment from
abroad. IDB will pay the Government 5Ω%  per annum on amounts advanced and will
repay the Government as the loans to its cutstomers mature.
IDB was establishecl in 1950 through the joint efforts of TurTkish private interests,
the Government and the World Bank, and has made a substanitial contribution to
industrial development. It has become an important institutional source of long-term
finance for private industry; it has pioneered in familiarizing Turkish industry with more
modern techniques of investment planning; and it has earned a reputation as a compe-
tent adviser on the technical and financial aspects of industrial enterprises. Its credits,
loans and equity participations have helped to bring additional private savings into
industry, and thus to raise output and increase employment.
POVER-SE YI-IAN PROJECT                $1.7 million cre(lit signed February 1, 1963
The credit will help Turkey to increase the supplv of electric power to help meet
the demands of growing industries and commerce in the Adana area. It will enable the
Cukurova Electric Company to install a new 18,000-kilowatt unit in its hydroelectric
generating plant onl the Seyhani River, and to mcet the cost of engineering studies for
two new power stations.
The area served by the company is a rich agricultural region with prosperous new
industries which, along with a new port at Mersin equipped with a grain elevator and a
16



flour mill, have led to rising demand for electric power. The company is now unable to
meet peak demand, obliging large consumers to operate their own high-cost diesel units.
Even the addition of the newv unit at Seyhan will not fully meet power requirements.
Plans are being drawiv up for two additional plants: a thermal station at Mersin and a
hlydroelectric plant on the Kadincik River near Tarsus.
Thle Turkish Governiment will re-lend the proceeds of the credit (except for the
amount resenred for enginieering studies) to the Cukurova Electric Company. The com-
pany will repav this loan over a period of 20 years with interest at a rate of 5Ω2% a year.
IRRICATION-SEYlIAN PROJECIT               $20 mnillion credit signed May 31, 1963
Increased agriculturdl production has been given the highest priority in Turkey's
development plans, both to meet domestic requirements and for export. Tllis credit will
finance the first stage of a project on the Adana Plain, under which 170,000 acres will
be drained and irrigated, making possible a large increase in the volume and value of
commercial crops.
T'he Adana Plain, potcntially one of the richest areas in Turkey, lies on the south-
ern coast between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. rnlIe Seyhan River
flows through the center of the Plain and the whole area is being developed as a multi-
purpose project comprising flood control, electric power and irrigation. Some irrigation
works were built in the 1940's. Levees for flood control were completed in 1953, and
the construction of a dam on the Seyhan River, an electric power plant and transmission
lines were finished in 1956 with the help of a 'World Bank loan of $22.9 million.
The Government of Turkey will be responsible for carrying out the new project,
which is estimated to cost the equivalent of $50 millioni. The public drainage and irriga-
tion works should be completed and in operation by March 1966. Most of the on-farm
works should be finished two vears later.

EL SALVADOR
H I C H- NV A Y S                      $8 million credit signed November 2, 1962
The credit will be used for the reconstruction of seven trunk roads, tlle construction
of four new feeder roads-227 miles in all-and the modernization of maintenance
17



operations on the El Salvador Coastal Highwav, whichi borders the Pacific from Guate-
mala to Honduras.
The seven trunk roads to be built to higher standards will accommodate steadily
increasinig traffic and substantially reduce transportation costs. Three of the roads link
the two largest cities, San Salvador and Santa Ana, and the country's two chief ports,
La Libertad and Acajutla. The four new feeder roads will serve fertile but little used
higlhland regions in the west and central parts of the country, leading to an increase in
land under cultivation and stimulating shifts in production from low-grade coffee to
more profitable food crops.
HAITI
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE                      $350,000 credit signied November 2, 1962
In 1956 the World Bank made a loan of $2.6 million for higlhway maintenance in
Haiti, includinig the establishment, equipping and training of a maintenanice organiza-
tion. Thle effect of better maintenianice of the road network has been to stimulate agri-
cultural output, particularly in central and nortlherni Haiti, and locally produced crops
are beginninig to replace imported foods. The new IDA credit seeks to conserve the
beneficial results obtained from the Bank-financed program. The credit will cover the
foreign cxchange costs of completing work nlow under way and of continuing road
maintenance and rehabilitation at the present level of operations for approximately one
year.
N I C A R A G U A
M A N A C U A W A T E R S U P PLY       $3 milliont credit signed September 7, 1962
This credit will help to finanice the first stage of a 20-year program to increase and
improve wvater supplies to the capital city of Managua. The program is required to meet
the needs of a growing population, many of whom are now without piped water, and to
reduce the present high incidence of water-bome disease. The Government of Nica-
ragua will re-lend the proceeds of the credit to Empresa Aguadora de Managua for
repayment over 24 years, including a four-year grace period, at 6% per annum.
The first stage of the project, whiclh is being carried out with the assistance of
foreign engineering consultanits, includes new pumpinig facilities for increased supply;
substantial improvemiients and extensioins of the transmission and distribution systems;
new service connectionis and meters; and improved chlorination and meter repair
facilities. A study of existing and possible supplementary water supply sources is also to
be undertaken.

APPENDIX F
Notes to Financial Statements
June 30, 1963
NOTE A
Amounts in currencies other than United States dollars have been translated into United States
dollars:
(i) In the cases of 55 members, at the par values as specified in the "Schedule of Par Values",
published by the International Monetary Fund.
(ii) In the cases of the remaining 21 members (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China,
Colombia, Ivory Coast, Korea, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay, Peru, Senegal, Sierra Leone,
Tanganyika, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Upper Volta, Viet-Nam and Yugoslavia), at the
rates used by such members in making payments of subscriptions to the Association.
NOTE B
Pursuant to Article IV, Section I (a) these amounts may be used by the Association for adminis-
trative expenses incurred by the Association in the territories of any Part It member whose cur-
rency is involved and, insofar as consistent with sound monetary policies, in payment for goods
and services produced in the territories of such member and required for projects financed by the
Association and located in such territories; and in addition when and to the extent justified by
the economic and financial situation of the member concerned as determined by agreement between
the member and the Association, such currency shall be freely convertible or otherwise usable for
projects financed by the Association and located outside the territories of the member.
NOTE C
The principal disbursed and outstanding on development credits and the accrued service charge
are expressed in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960
and the equivalent is payable by the borrowers in currencies which the Association determines to
be freely convertible or freely exchangeable by the Association for currencies of other members
of the Association, except that such amount would be reduced if (a) there is a uniform proportionate
reduction in the par values of the currencies of all members of the International Monetary Fund or
(b) the Association determines to do so because of a substantial reduction in the value of a major
currency. The foregoing does not apply to a credit of $9,000,000 which is expressed and is repayable
in legal tender dollars.
NOTE D
Subscriptions and supplementary resources are expressed in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960.
NOTE E
Payment ot this portion of the subscriptions of members is due on November 8 in each of the
years 1963 and 1964 as follows: One and one quarter percent of the subscription of each member
is payable annually in gold or freely convertible currency; eighteen percent of the subscription of
each member is payable annually (a) in gold or freely convertible currency by Part I members and
(b) in the currency of the subscribing member by Part 11 members.
NOTE F
Under Article IV, Section 2 each member is required, if the par value of its currency is reduced
or the foreign exchange value of its currency has in the opinion of the Association depreciated
to a significant extent within that member's territories, to maintain the value of the Association's
holdings of its ninety percent currency, including the principal amount of any notes substituted
therefor, and the Association is required if the par value of the member's currency is increased, or
the foreign exchange value of the member's currency has in the opinion of the Association appre-
ciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, to return to the member the increase
in the value of such ninety percent currency held by the Association; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall apply only so long as and to the extent that such currency shall not have been
initially disbursed or exchanged for the currency of another member.
The equivalent of $303,000 is due from I member in order to maintain the value of the Association's
holdings of its ninety percent currency as required under Article IV, Section 2.
NOTE G
The contributing member (Sweden) and the Association have, by agreement, the same respective
rights and obligations as to maintenance of value as are set forth in Article IV, Section 2, of the
Articles of the Association.
