REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND STAFF
To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed to be internationally
competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and largely expatriate staff. The Bank Group's staff
salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if warranted, is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by
private financial and industrial firms and by representative public sector agencies in the U.S. market. After analyses of updated comparator salaries,
the Board approved an average increase in the salary structure of 3.32 percent for fiscal 2009, effective July 1, 2008, for Washington-based staff.
    The annual salaries (net of taxes) of executive management of the World Bank Group were as follows for the period July 1, 2008, through
June 30, 2009:

Note: Because World Bank Group (WBG) staff, other than U.S. citizens, usually are not required to pay income taxes on their WBG compensation, the salaries are set on a net-of-tax basis, which is generally
equivalent to the after-tax take-home pay of the employees of the comparator organizations and firms from which WBG salaries are derived. Only a relative small minority of staff will reach the upper third
of the salary range.

a. Includes annual leave; medical, life, and disability insurance; accrued termination benefits; and other nonsalary benefits.

    Bangladesh faces similar energy sector problems. Manufacturers
surveyed in the Bank's most recent Investment Climate Assessment
estimate that power shortages reduce sales by about 12 percent a year. To
help address the problem, the Bank approved $350 million in fiscal 2009 for
the Siddhirganj Peaking Power Project, designed to increase reliable power
during periods of peak demand. The project builds on the Bank Group's
long history of involvement in Bangladesh's energy sector, including
support to the successful Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy
Development Program, which has helped bring power to hundreds of
thousands of consumers through grid connections and solar home
systems. And in Nepal, the Bank committed $89.2 million in response to the
country's unprecedented energy crisis, in which grid-based consumers
were supplied with electricity for only eight hours per day.
    Inadequate road infrastructure is also a critical constraint for
sustainable and inclusive growth in South Asia. In Sri Lanka, national
roads carry more than 70 percent of all traffic. But uncontrolled roadside
