WASHINGTON, D. C.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present
fairly, in terms of United States currency, the financial position of International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development at June 30, 1960, and the results of
its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year. Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the account-
ing records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary.
