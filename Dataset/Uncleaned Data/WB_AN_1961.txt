In accordance with Section 10 of the By-Laws of the International Bank

tive Directors to submit to the Board of Governors this Annual Report of
the Bank for the fiscal year July 1, 1960 to June 30, 1961.
The first section of this year's Report surveys the various activities
of the Bank in the fiscal year. Two Annexes follow, one giving a country-by-

the details of borrowings. Finally, there appear the customary Appendices,
including the Financial Statements as of June 30, 1961; the Administrative
Budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1962; and a Statement of Bank
Loans.
Sincerely yours,
