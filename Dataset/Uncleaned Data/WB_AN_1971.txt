with education projects related to agriculture.          This applies with special force to the infrastruc-
ture -chiefly transportation, power and other
- ~    ~        public utilities-which is essential to the estab-
lishment of modern industry and the expansion of
agriculture beyond the subsistence level. Together
4 L      i  they claim a high proportion of scarce resources.
Consequently it is a matter of strategic importance
X  g  l  that resources be allocated in accordance with
sound developmental priorities, and  that the
planning, construction and operation of projects
in these sectors be as efficient as possible.
This is an area in which the World Bank Group
has had its most extensive experience, and in
which its contribution to development through
technical assistance has been most pronounced.
There are two main reasons: the tie between
Bank Group finance and technical assistance, and
tne exceptional degree of continuity that has
characterized much of the Group's lending, es-
pecially in transportation and electric power. (For
a review of Bank Group technical assistance activ-
ities, see page 29.)
Bank Group financing has been closely related
to the acceptance and effective use of technical
advice and assistance, both on general policy
questions and in matters of organization, admin-
istration and finance, as well as on the technical
aspects of projects. In the case of transportation
and public utilities, technical assistance in helping
to build efficient institutions may be especiaell
important because of the strategic relationship of
these sectors to others, as well as because of the
share of public resources they command. Bene-
ficial results from such assistance, however, do
not flow automatically from conditions attached
pole  oto finance for projects, nor can they be assured
it     merely because advice has been requested and
it given. Rather, they are often a function or con-
tinuity in operations, making possible the evolu-
tion at the staff level of a genuinely common
effort by lender and borrower together.
Relation to other issues
Especially where policy changes or institutional
refoims are necessary, a close and confident rela-
tionship can be crucial to the effectiveness of
technical assistance and the related projects. T his
is especially evident in many countries where the

grant element in the total flow is certainly lower
than indicated above.
On the other hand, even allowing for these fac-
tors would not greatly alter the impression that
official development assistance continues to be
made available to developing countries on highly
concessional terms. Before adjustment for aid
tying, the grant element on such assistance has
averaged around 80%  in recent years. The few
countries which have not received official devel-
opment assistance on highly concessional terms
are for the most part countries with relatively high
per capita income or prospects of rapid export
growth.
The terms of private loans are also relevant to
the debtor country. The grant element in export
credits, not to mention bonds issued by develop-
ing countries and commercial bank credits, is
clearly very much lower than that in official assist-
ance, and for many of the "middle income" devel-    /
oping countries which use these sources of funds
most heavily-Argentina, the Republic of China,
Greece, Iran, Mexico and Venezuela are examples
-the grant element in the total flow is inevitably
rather low. However, the terms on which capital
has been made available to most individual devel-
oping countries have been reasonably in line with
the productivity of capital and "transformation"
possibilities in the countries concerned.
