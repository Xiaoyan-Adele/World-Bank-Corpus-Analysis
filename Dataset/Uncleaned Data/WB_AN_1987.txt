The severe deterioration in Malaysia's terms
of trade contributed to a drop of about 5.4
percent in merchandise exports. Imports fell
by the same amount, however, as inventories
were drawn down and imports of consumption
goods were curtailed. As a result, the current-
account deficit declined only modestly, from
2.5 percent of GNP in 1985 to around 1.8
percent in 1986. Although the debt-service

Failure to Strengthen Creditworthiness
Over the past year, most Latin American           -        e   v  ,     -&            a
countries also experienced serious setbacks in
their efforts to strengthen their external posi-
tion and restore creditworthiness. These set-
backs, in large part, were the result of adverse
external developments. The surplus in the re-
gion's merchandise trade balance fell by 45
percent as a consequence of a 15 percent
decline in export earnings and a slight increase
in the level of imports. Except in Brazil, the
decline of export revenues was primarily the
consequence of further declines, by 12 per- -l
cent, in world prices of most of the region's
major exports: the region's external terms of
trade fell by 9 percent after falling by 5 percent
the year before. Because declines in world
interest rates were not large enough to com-
pensate for the deterioration in the region's
merchandise trade balance, which fell from
$33.5 billion in 1985 to $18.5 billion, there was
a substantial increase (S10 billion) in the cur-
rent deficit of the external accounts-from -$4
billion in 1985 to -$14 billion in 1986. Capital

a Includes thirty-two development credits totalrng US$1,288000 approved by the Association, subject to the avalaability of additional commimert authority
b Surpluses and deticis in resources under fully commited replenishments are primanly attributable to exchange-rate fluctuations in value to terms of current
US doliars, of resources expressed m currencies other than US dollars The value of these resources at any given time may be greater or less than the
development credits committed against them, since these development credits are denominated in US dollars or SDRs
IDA reviews periodical y the resource position under fully commited replenishments and, it necessary, allocates portions of the resources that become available
tor commitment during the period to those replenishrments For IDA, these allocations will include income from operations until it equals the cumulative losses
from operatiors for the period July 1, 1979 to December 31 1984, totalling $353,815,000 Losses incurred during that period were not reduced from
commitment authonty ir accordance with the decision of the Executive Directors that IDA's commitment authorty not be reduced by the amount of deficits
during the sixth reptenishment period The decision reflected the expectation that future ncome would be availabe to reduce these losses A I ncome earned
subsequent to that penod, amounting to $120,692,000 at June 30, 1987, has been allocated for this purpose

President and Board of Governors,
International Development Association,
Special Fund Administered by the International
Development Association, and the Special Facility
for Sub-Saharan Africa Administered by the
International Development Association
We have examined the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through F of the
International Development Association, Special Fund Administered by the International Devel-
opment Association, and the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa Administered by the
International Development Association. Our examinations of these statements were made in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the
accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.
In our report dated July 30. 1986. our opinion on the fiscal year 1986 financial statements of the
International Development Association was qualified as being subject to the effects on the financial
statements of such adjustments, if any, as might have been required upon resolution of the
uncertainty as to the standard of value to be substituted for the 1960 dollar in determining the
repayment obligations of certain of the Association's development credits. As described in the
Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the notes to the financial statements,
the Executive Directors decided on June 30, 1987 to value such credits at the rate of $1.20635 per
1960 dollar, the value used in the fiscal year 1986 financial statements. Accordingly, our present
opinion on the fiscal year 1986 financial statements, as presented herein, is no longer qualified with
respect to this matter.
In our opinion, the financial statements examined by us present fairly, in terms of United States
dollars. the financial position of the International Development Association, Special Fund
Administered by the International Development Association, and the Special Facility for Sub-
Saharan Afnca Administered by the International Development Association at June 30. 1987 and
1986, and the changes in their commitment resources and liquid funds for the years then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.
