Rice drying on a cement courtvard in a Nigerian
village. The countries of sub-Saharan Africa face a
year of opportunity in 1986. Rainfall has been
ample, coffee exporters are benefiting frotn large
price increases, and oil importers are saving valuable
foreign exchange through the sharp decline in oil
prices. Just as governments must seize on this
window of opportunity by continuing the process of
economic reform, so, too, donor governments must
continue their support of those reforms with
much-needed assistance.

Loans: IBRD
As of June 30, 1986, the IBRD held $104,942
million of loans. This amount included $11,357
million of loans that had been approved but had
not yet become effective and loans to the Inter-
national Finance Corporation of $1,422 million.
Disbursed and outstanding loans, including
6,000                                           $838 million to the IFC, totaled $61,064 million,
an increase of $19,682 million since June 30,
1985. Of this increase, $4,226 million was due to
net disbursements, while $15,456 million re-
sulted from translation adjustments.
Disbursements on loans to countries totaled
$8,263 million in fiscal 1986, compared with
$8,645 million in fiscal 1985. Since the IBRD be-
gan operations, it has disbursed $76,693 million
to its borrowing member countries.
Repayments of principal on the IBRD's loans,
based on the exchange rates at the time of dis-
bursement, amounted to $3,824 million in fiscal
1986. This included $14 million to purchasers of
participations in IBRD loans. Cumulative loan
2,000                                          repayments as of June 30, 1986, were $26,180

and Development
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through G present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development at June 30, 1986 and 1985, and the results of its operations and the changes in its
financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting princi-
ples consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with gener-
ally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

*Recassoiied for comparative purposes
a. In accordance with the decisior of the Executive Directors Inat the Association's commitment authority not be reduced by tne amount ot
deficils during rhe sixth replenishment period, the Association's resources available for commitment were increased by the amount of the
accumulated deficits forthe period from July 1. 1979 to Decemoer 31. 1984. reflecting the expectation that future ncome would be available to
reduce these losses Losses incurred subsequent to December 31, 1984 have reduced the Association's commitment authority. Pending a
review of the Association's financial policies. income earned sy the Association after the sixth replenishment is not being used to increase
commitment authority. Accordingly, the item ' . r.net loss available tor commitment' totaling S353.815,000 as ot December 31. 1984, has
been reduced to S339,335.000 by subsequent income earned through June 30, 1986
x. The net balance of resources oi $(34,610d000) shown asove represents Ui) $308,877.000 ol resources nha; have become asailable lor
commitment and are included herein but have not been allocated to specific develooment credits and (I!) a shortfall of $343,487,000 which IS
pr marily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations ir the value, in terms of current US dollars, of resources exoressec in other memnber curren-
cies aroc provided in prior fiscal years The vaiue of these resources at any given time may be greater or less than the development credits
committed against them, since these development credits are denomrnated in US dollars or SoRs

President and Board of Governors,
Special Fund Administered by the
International Development Association
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through E present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, the financial position of the Special Fund Administered by the International
Development Association at June 30, 1986 and 1985, and the results of its operations and the changes
in its resources available for commitment for the years then ended, in conformity with generally ac-
cepted accounting principles consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were made in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the ac-
counting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
