My dear Mr. Chairman:


     In accordance with Section 2 of the By-Laws of the International
Development Association, I have been authorized by the Executive
Directors to submit to the Board of Governors this Annual Report of
the Association covering the fiscal year 1961/62.
     The Report opens with a general account of IDA activities during
the year, including a discussion of its lending procedures. There fol-
lows a country-by-country summary of the development credits made
during the year.

                                        Sincerely yours,




                                                   President




Chairman

                              NOTE

IDA has a separate legal existence. from the World Bank and its
finances are entirely distinct. Its operations, however, are so closely
integrated with those of the Bank-the two institutions share the
same Executive Directors, management and staff-that its per-
formance cannot be viewed in isolation. IDA is in fact one ele-
ment in a unified group of institutions working under the aegis of
the World Bank to promote the economic development of the
less developed countries. For this reason, this Report should be
read in conjunction with the 1961/62 Annual Report of the Bank,
       which surveys the activities of the group as a whole.

IN ITS FIRST FULL YEAR OF ACTIVITY, THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AssocrATION
(IDA) has been able to provide substantial financial assistance to important develop-
ment projects in its member countries. There has also been further progress in develop-
ing a pattern of terms and procedures for the appropriate and effective use of IDA funds.
     The eighteen new cn.~dits of the year totaled $134 million, bringing IDA's total
commitments to $235 million. The year's credits are helping to finance development
projects in eight countries:, Colombia, Costa Rica, India (six credits), Jordan, Pakistan
 (three credits), Paraguay, the Republic of China (four credits) and Swaziland.
     Agricultural improvement received the largest amount of IDA finance during the
year; a total of $66.2 million was lent, principally for irrigation and drainage in farming
areas in India and Pakistan, ~here greater agricultural output is vitally needed to keep
pace with growing populations.
     Credits in the transportation sector were in second place at $38 million; of this,
$31 million was for projects in Latin America. In most cases these credits will also be
of direct benefit to agriculture by opening new areas for farming and providing efficient
farm-to-market road systems.
     Of the remaining credits, one of $18.5 million was made for electric power, to assist
development in the Damodar Valley of India. Credits of $2 million and $4.4 million,
respectively, were. extended to finance municipal water supply systems in Amman
(Jordan) and Taipei (Taiwan). The only IDA credit for industry was of $5 million to
assist the China Development Corporation in the promotion of private industrial ven-
tures in Taiwan.




                                                                                              I   s
              THE PRIMARY PURPOSE underlying the establishment of IDA was the creation of a
        supplementary source of development capital for countries whose balance of payments
        prospects would not justify their incurring, or continuing to incur, external debt entirely
        on conventional terms. The financial terms attaching to IDA credits have, therefore,
        been designed with 9ue regard to this purpose.
              IDA credits are repayable in foreign exchange, but on very lenient terms. In each
        of the credits so far made, a government has been the borrower; the credits are repay-
        able over a period of 50 years, free of interest; there is a IO-year period of grace, follow-
        ing which 13 per annum is repayable over the next 10 years, and 33 per annum over
        the final 30 years; to help to meet IDA's administrative costs, a service charge of % of
        13 per annum is payable on amounts withdrawn and outstanding. Compared with
        conventional loans, these terms bring substantial alleviation to the repayment obligations
        of borrowing countries, and bear much less heavily on their balance of payments.
              It was not intended that these concessionary terms of IDA financing should result
        in the extension of financial subsidies to the actual projects on which IDA funds are
        employed, or that IDA funds should be used to finance a project which could not
        satisfy normal criteria of economic and financial viability. Hence, a project submitted
        for IDA financing is expected to meet the same technical, economic, financial and ad-
        ministrative standards as the World Bank itself would look for if the Bank were making
        a loan for that project on conventional terms. Furthermore, in the case of revenue-
        producing projects, IDA requires that the proceeds of the IDA credit be invested in the
        project on a normal business-like basis and that the price of the goods or services pro-
        duced by the project be fixed at levels which will make the investment remunerative.
              If the proceeds of an IDA credit were passed on to the agency executing a revenue-
        producing project at the concessionary terms obtained by the borrowing government
        itself, the effect would be to give the project a substantial financial subsidy. This was
        no part of IDA's purposes, and would encourage the waste and misdirection of scarce
        investment funds. IDA therefore requires that the borrowing government, if it re-lends
        the proceeds of an IDA credit for investment in a revenue-producing project, will do so
        on terms which will impose on the agency executing the project the normal financial
        discipline with regard to the fixing of rates and charges to consumers.
              It remains, of course, a matter of judgment whether and to what extent a project
        should be put on a revenue-producing basis, and what should be regarded as suitably
        business-like re-lending terms, taking into account such factors as the existing pattern of
        interest rates in the borrowing country and whether the foreign exchange risk is passed




6   I
on to the ultimate borrower or retained by the government of the member country.
Different solutions which have been found are reflected in the specific re-lending terms
described in the country sections which follow. In cases where it is not practicable to
establish direct financial discipline of this kind, as for example in the case of a non-
revenue-producing highway project or program, IDA takes care to apply the criterion
that the project itself should be of high developmental priority and that expenditures
on the project should bring commensurate benefit to the recipient country.



    THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST YEAR      has amply confirmed the need for more develop-
ment capital on terms imposing a minimum burden on the balance of payments of less
developed countries. Many of these countries are now bringing a growing number of
sound projects to the point where construction can begin, given the required external
capital. At the same time, because of fresh borrowing for development purposes, the
external debt of many of these countries continues to grow, much of it on short and
medium term, and weighing more and more heavily on their balance of payments.
     These developments, combined with the fact that within IDA itself the prepara-
tory processing work is now being brought to completion on an increasing number of
deserving projects, are causing the commitment of IDA funds to accelerate. By
June 30, 1962, IDA had signed credit agreements requiring $235 million out of the
$757 million of freely convertible resources available from its initial subscriptions. Con-
sidering that about another $250 million of IDA funds would be needed for India and
Pakistan by June 30, 1963, to fulfill the indications given at Consortium meetings, and
in view of the mounting requirements for operations in other member countries, it was
already apparent by the summer of 1962 that most or all of IDA's initial resources
might well be committed by mid-1963. Steps have therefore been taken to place the
question of replenishment of these resources on the agenda of the Annual Meeting
of the Board of Governors of the Association in September of this year.
     In this context, a special supplementary contribution made by Sweden to IDA's
resources in May 1962 was warmly welcomed. The amount was SKr 30,144,165 ( equiva-
lent to $5,827,000); it has been made available in freely convertible form, neither tied
to Swedish procurement nor restricted to use in any specified countries or in any speci-
fied projects. This was the first supplementary contribution to IDA's resources from
any of its member countries.

        In the fiscal year eleven countries joined IDA, bringing membership to 62 countries and
        total subscriptions to the equivalent of $917,160,000. Table I lists the new members,
        all of which are so-called Part II members, required to pay only 103 of their subscrip-
        tions in convertible currencies, and the remaining 903 in their own currencies.

             Member countries of IDA pay their subscriptions over a five-year period; second-
        year payments were therefore received from previous members during the year, as well
        as the first- and second-year payments of new members. Total receipts in the fiscal year
        were $178 million.




                               INCOME AND DISBURSEMENTS

        During the year income, almost entirely derived from the investment of IDA funds
        awaiting disbursement, was $2.2 million. Under the cost-sharing arrangement with the
        Bank, the total expenditures allocated to IDA were $1.1 million, leaving a net addition
        of $1.l million to IDA's resources.
             The year's disbursements were $12,168,476. The rate of disbursement will increase
        in the near future as many projects being financed by IDA come under construction.

HIGHWAY        PROJECT                         $2.8 million credit signed March 14, 1962

     Swaziland, a British dependency in southern Africa, has an area of 6,700 square
miles and a population of 250,000. There is as yet no railway and the territory is com-
pletely dependent on road transport. Since 1958 the Government has been carry-
ing out a construction program to improve the roads, particularly the main trunk roads.
This credit will help to finance the construction to all-weather standards of the most
important highway in Swaziland, extending 112 miles across the country from the South
African border on the west to the Mozambique border on the east. The new highway
will stimulate economic growth and facilitate external trade. It will link the most
productive agricultural, forestry and mineral areas with the largest township, and will
open new land for cultivation.

IRRIGATION         PROJECT                     $3.7 million credit signed August 30, 1961

     About one-half of Taiwan's population of over 11 million earn their living from
agriculture. Although efficiency is high, the cropping pattern on the farmlands of the
coastal plain-the most productive area-is restricted by the limited supply of water for
irrigation. Because of the topography, more irrigation water must come from the
further exploitation of ground water resources.
     A program for the development of deep wells was begun in 1958 when the Pro-
vincial Government of Taiwan established the Ground Water Development Bureau.
The Bureau constructs and equips wells for Irrigation Associations which operate
irrigation works in their respective districts. The project which the IDA credit will
assist is a continuation of this program and consists of the provision of about 765 deep




                                                                                            I9
         wells to provide more irrigation water for approximately 207,500 acres in the western
         and southern plains. The water will be used on land operated by more than 100,000
         farmers and should increase the gross value of farm production by the equivalent of
         about $15 million a year.
              The Government of the Republic of China is re-lending the proceeds of the credit
         to the Province of Taiwan which is making funds available to four Irrigation Associa-
         tions under an arrangement by which the Associations will repay the credits over 20
         years, at 123 interest per annum, the customary terms for such credits in Taiwan.

         DREDGING         PROGRAM                       $2.2 million credit signed August 30, 1961

              This credit will finance expenditures by the Taiwan Provincial Government on
         dredging equipment, engineering services and the training of personnel for the improve-
         ment and maintenance of Taiwan's three commercial harbors, Keelung, Kaohsiung and
         Hualien. The Republic of China is re-lending the equivalent of the credit to the
         Province of Taiwan, repayable in 15 years, at 123 interest per annum. Keelung and
         Kaohsiung serve the western plain which contains most of Taiwan's population and
         economic activity; Hualien serves the narrow eastern coastal region and is only now
         being developed into a port for international trade.
              The volume of traffic is expected to increase at all three ports. The new equip-
         ment will not only be used to expand the capacity of the ports to handle the growing
         trade, but will also replace existing equipment which has passed its economic life and is
         already inadequate for present maintenance operations. Maneuvering areas will be en-
         larged at the western ports to avoid congestion and provide protection from typhoons,
         and the harbor areas will be deepened and extended.

         TAIPEI     WATER       SUPPLY                $4.4 million credit signed September 6, 1961

               The credit will help to finance the expansion and improvement of water supply
         facilities in Taipei, the largest city in Taiwan, and in eight suburban communities. At
         present public water supplies are available only in Taipei City itself and in two suburbs.
         Over the Taipei region as a whole, it is estimated that by 1970 a total of about 360,000
         cubic meters of water daily-about double the present output-will be needed to meet
         the requirements of the rapidly increasing population and to extend service to those
         communities which at present lack a public water supply. The new facilities being in-
         stalled with IDA assistance should meet this demand. They consist of a river water

pumping station and pipeline, a new filtmtion plant, two reservoirs, a substantial in-
crease in the distribution system, and at least three new deep wells. The project is
being carried out by the Taipei Water Works and is part of the current four-year eco-
nomic plan for Taiwan. The Republic of China is re-lending the equivalent of the
credit to the Taipei Water Works, repayable in 23 years, at 123 interest per annum.

INDUSTRIAL          DEVELOPMENT                $5 million credit signed December 1, 1961

     The credit will provide the additional foreign exchange needed by the China De-
velopment Corporation (CDC) for its lending over the next two or three years. The
Republic of China is re-lending the equivalent of the credit to CDC, repayable over
30 years, at 123 interest per annum. CDC was established in May 1959 by leading
bankers and businessmen in Taiwan to assist the establishment, modernization and ex-
pansion of private industrial enterprises in the island. With no organized bond market
and limited resources available from commercial banks, many companies have had to
depend on short-term loans from private money lenders at very high rates of interest.
The principal function of CDC is to offer long-term financing, both in local currency
and in foreign exchange, for private industry. As such, it has an important role in the
development of private industry under China's current Four-Year Plan, which calls for
an annual increase of almost 163 in manufacturing output. At the time the IDA
credit was made, CDC had made over 70 loans aggregating the equivalent of nearly
$10 million, mostly at medium and long term.

IND I A
             CREDITS      FOR    AGRICULTURAL           DEVELOPMENT

     One of the basic objectives of economic development in India is a substantial in-
crease in agricultural production, especially of foodstuffs, to meet the needs of the
expanding population. During the first two Five-Year Plans, agricultural production
rose by about 353. Under the Third Plan, India aims at a rate of increase almost
twice as great, with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in food grains and a substantial
increase in the output of commercial crops. Since little new land can be opened up,
emphasis is being placed on irrigation and other means of intensifying production and
increasing crop yields, and on the restoration of land which has become infertile be-
cause of flooding and water-logging. The first four IDA credits described below were
for these purposes.




                                                                                             111
IRRIGATION-UTTAR                PRADESH        PROJECT

                                               $6 million credit signed September 6, 1961
     The credit will assist in financing the drilling and equipping of 800 tubewells for
the irrigation of 320,000 acres of land in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous State in
India and one which produces about a third of the country's wheat and sugar and about
half the barley. The wells will be built and operated by the State's Irrigation Depart-
ment which has had long and successful experience in tubewell irrigation. The project
should make possible a substantial increase in the agricultural output of the State. The
Government of India is re-lending the equivalent of the credit to the State of Uttar
Pradesh for 12 years, at 4Ys3 interest per annum.

IRRIGATION-SALANDI                 PROJECT

                                               $8 million credit signed November 22, 1961
     This credit will assist in financing the Salandi project for the irrigation of about
225,000 acres in the State of Orissa in eastern India. The Government of India will
re-lend the equivalent of the credit to the State of Orissa, repayable over 10 years, in-
cluding 3 years grace, at 43 interest per annum. The area is now under dry farming
and produces only one crop a year; crop failures are frequent because of the unreliability
of rainfall. With irrigation, double cropping will be possible on almost 403 of the
land; higher yields should be obtained for rice, the main crop, and new crops will be
introduced. The project includes the construction of a dam on the Salandi River, a
45-mile main canal and about 450 miles of distribution canals and related structures.
The State of Orissa will also provide technical assistance to farmers who will use the
irrigation water.

IRRICATION-SHETRUNJI                   PROJECT

                                            $4.5 million credit signed November 22, 1961
     The credit will help to finance completion of the Shetrunji project for the irriga-
tion of 86,000 acres in an arid but fertile area of the State of Gujarat in western India.
The Government of India will finance 503 of the cost of the project; the equivalent
of the credit will be applied against this contribution and will be re-lent to the State of
Gujarat, repayable over 10 years, with 3 years grace, at 43 interest per annum. Some of
the civil works, including a dam across the Shetrunji River, have already been built.
The work being undertaken to complete the project involves the building of about 94
miles of main and distribution canals, houses, workshops, buildings and service roads.
The State of Gujarat will provide technical services to farmers to bring about prompt
utilization of the available water.


IRRIGATION          AND    DRAINAGE-PUNJAB                PROJECT

                                             $10 million credit signed November 22, 1961
     With the introduction of perennial irrigation in the 19th century, the Punjab
became one of the chief agricultural States in India. The extension of irrigation and
the building of embankments for roads, railways and town sites, in the absence of ade-
quate drainage, has caused the water table to rise, with the result that water-logging is
severe over wide areas of the State and agricultural production has been thereby re-
duced. The high water table has also aggravated the problem of flooding which occurs
in years when the monsoon is heavy. The State Government of the Punjab is now
constructing a system of adequate surface drainage and building embankments to keep
rivers in their channels. The project being assisted by the IDA credit includes the con-
struction of 17 miles of such embankments, the enlargement of 300 miles of existing
drains, and thf:! excavation of 2,000 miles of new drains. The Government of India is
re-lending the equivalent of the credit to the State of the Punjab, repayable over 30
years, including 5 years grace, at 4Yz3 interest per annum.


IRRIGATION-SONE               PROJECT              $15 million credit signed June 29, 1962

      The credit will assist in financing a project being carried out by the State of Bihar
to improve and extend the Sone irrigation system in the western part of the State,
making possible the irrigation of about 1,000,000 crop-acres annually.
      The Sone project area is located just west of the city of Patna on the Sone River,
a tributary of the Ganges, and has been under irrigation for over 80 years. The primary
reason for the present project is that the existing diversion weir needs to be replaced:
the loss of water from leakage, along with heavy siltation, has led to serious operational
difficulties. A new diversion barrage will now be built and the canal system, now com-
prising about 427 miles of canals on one side of the river and 1,235 miles on the other,
is being remodeled and extended. The project should result in much higher crop yields
and, when the water is folly utilized, the annual gross value of production will be nearly
double the present level of 207 million rupees ( $43 million). For this type of project,




                                                                                              J   13
the Government of India provides 603 and the State of Bihar 403 of the finance; the
Indian Government contribution, part of which the IDA credit will finance, is repayable
by the State of Bihar over 7 to 15 years, at about 43 interest per annum.


POWER-DAMODAR               VALLEY       PROfECT

                                            $18.5 million credit signed February 14, 1962

     The credit will assist in financing an expansion of the electric power system of the
Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), a semi-autonomous governmental organization
established in 1948 to execute a unified scheme for the development of the Valley. The
Government of India and the States of Bihar and of West Bengal provide capital for
the DVC construction program in the form of non-repayable advances at about
4¥23 per annum; the credit will represent part of the Government's contribution.
     The Damodar Valley is an area of some 9,250 square miles lying northwest of
Calcutta. DVC has already completed several projects there for the generation and
transmission of electric power and for irrigation and flood control, assisted by earlier
World Bank loans totaling a net amount of $49.2 million. The IDA credit will help
to finance the addition of a 140,000-kilowatt generating unit at the existing 165,000-
kilowatt Durgapur thermal power station, and the expansion of transmission facilities.
The project forms part of DVC's expansion program during India's Third Plan under
which DVC plans to increase the capacity of its plants to 1,084,000 kilowatts, or more
than double present capacity. This will be sufficient to meet the needs of its system by
1965, after which further expansion will be necessary to meet the requirements of the
Damodar Valley area, now the site of four steel mills and many other heavy industries
based on the rich mineral deposits of the Valley.


JORDAN
AMMAN       WATER       SUPPLY               $2 million credit signed December 22, 1961

      The credit will be used to help finance expansion and improvement of the water
supply system in the capital city of Amman. The works to be undertaken include the
development of several new wells, pumping stations, improvement of existing water
mains, additional storage capacity, water treatment facilities and a laboratory for water
testing. The Government of Jordan will re-lend the equivalent of the credit to the
Municipality, repayable over 23 years, including 3 years grace, at 43 interest per annum.
     The population of Amman has doubled over the past ten years. Measures have
been taken by the Municipal Government to adapt the water supply system to the in- .
crease in demand, but they have been inadequate to provide even a minimum supply
of safe water. The project which the IDA credit will assist falls within the framework
of a 25-year master plan and should provide a safe and dependable supply of water
sufficient to meet the city's requirements until 1972.


PAKISTAN
I R R I GAT I 0 N -   DA C C A I N A R A Y A N G A N J I D E M R A   P R 0 JE C T
                                                 $1 million credit signed October 19, 1961

      The credit will assist the East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority
in the execution of the Dacca/Narayanganj/Demra irrigation project. The project, the
first of its kind in East Pakistan, is designed to increase agricultural production in a
densely populated and poor area, and will serve as a pilot project for the development
of similar schemes elsewhere in East Pakistan. The equivalent of the IDA credit. will
be re-lent by the Pakistan Government to the Province of East Pakistan, repayable over
32 years, including 5. years grace, at 43 interest per annum.
      The project will be carried out on an area of 20,600 acres of land immediately
southeast of Dacca, where most of the land is flooded every year to a depth of from
5 to 15 feet after the monsoon rains. At present it produces one crop of rice a year and
lies unused until the next annual flood. Under the development scheme, a dual purpose
pumping station will regulate the supply of water: during the monsoon, excess water
will be pumped out of the area, and during the rest of the year water will be pumped
in from the Lakhya River for distribution through canals to be excavated in the area.
This will make possible three crops annually on most of the land and two crops on the
remainder, thus tripling annual average production per acre.


INLAND       PORTS      PROJECT                $2 million credit signed November 22, 1961

     This credit will help to finance a program to improve inland water transport in
East Pakistan where, in general, it is the most economical means of transport and in
some areas the only means of transport. About 603 of the two billion ton-miles of
freight carried annually in East Pakistan is transported by watercraft. In the Greater
Dacca area alone, the most important commercial center, over six million passengers
use water transport annually.




                                                                                             J   15
     In 1958 the Inland Water Transport Authority was established as an agency of the
East Pakistan Government to provide river conservancy services, to operate and improve
inland ports, terminals and storage facilities, and to supervise inland water transporta-
tion operations. The equivalent of the IDA credit will be re-lent by the Pakistan Gov-
ernment to the Province of East Pakistan, repayable over 25 years, with 5 years grace,
at 43 interest per annum, to assist the first phase of the Authority's program to be
carried out under Pakistan's Second Five-Year Plan. The principal works to be under-
taken consist of the installation of cargo and passenger facilities at the five main inland
river ports, Dacca, Khulna, Narayanganj, Barisal and Chandpur. The IDA credit will
also pay for the services of experts to assist the Authority for a period of at least two
years, and for a study of navigable waterways that will lead to recommendations for
detailed surveys.


DRAINAGE         AND     SALINITY        CONTROL-KHAIRPUR                 PROJECT
                                                    $18 million credit signed June 29, 1962

      This credit will assist a project being carried out by the West Pakistan Water and
Power Development Authority to restore the productivity of more than 300,000 acres of
farmland in the Khairpur area in West Pakistan. Khairpur is located on the left bank
of the Indus River near the Sukkur Barrage, about 300 miles north of Karachi, and is
part of the Indus Basin, the most important area of irrigation in Pakistan. The Basin
extends 800 miles northward from the mouth of the Indus River on the Arabian Sea
to the Salt Range Mountains and has been under large-scale perennial irrigation since
the tum of the century. Lack of suitable drainage facilities has led to the progressive
deterioration of several million acres of fertile land in the last ten years.
      The project area comprises 355,000 acres of land which has been under irrigation
since 1932. The water table is now less than five feet from the surface over 130,000
acres, and is rising at an average rate of nearly four inches annually. As the water table
rises, evaporation leaves a residue of salt in the soil; as a result, about 203 of the proj-
ect area has so far gone out of production and there has been a general decline in crop
yields; continued deterioration of the soils would endanger the livelihood of tens of
thousands of families.
      The Khairpur project aims to lower the groundwater level through pumping and
drainage. In addition, salt concentrations in surface soils will be flushed out by heavy
irrigation and drainage. The project will not only prevent a further decline in produc-
tivity, but will make possible an increase in farm production valued at 52 million rupees
($11 million) annually. The equivalent of the credit will be re-lent by the Pakistan
Government to the Province of West Pakistan, repayable over 30 years, including 5
years grace, at 43 interest per annum.

COLOMBIA
HIGHWAY        PROGRAM                        $19.5 million credit signed August 28, 1961

     This credit, together with a World Bank loan of $19.5 million made on the same
date, will assist a highway improvement program of the Colombian Government, in-
volving the reconstruction or new construction of about 800 miles of roads forming part
of the main road network of Colombia, the preparation ·of designs on another 300 miles
of roads, an expansion of maintenance operations and the procurement of maintenance
equipment. The IDA credit will be used for road construction work. When the current
program is completed, Colombia will have an all-weather highway system connecting
most of her important cities.

COSTA       RICA
HIGHWAY        PROGRAM                        $5.5 million credit signed October 13, 1961

     This credit, together with a World Bank loan of $5.5 million made on the same
date, will help to finance the reconstruction and construction by the Costa Rican Gov-
ernment of about 420 miles of road, representing about one-third of the country's
national and regional highway system, and the improvement of road maintenance oper-
ations. Most of the highways to be improved serve the central plateau, populated by
about three-fifths of the population and containing the bulk of the country's agricultural
and manufacturing wealth. Improvements of the existing roads will cut vehicle operat-
ing costs by 123 to 253 on most of the roads. Three new highway sections will be
built, two to relieve severe congestion in the San Jose area, and the third to open up a
rich agricultural region. These works, together with the improvement of maintenance




                                                                                             117
         operations, constitute the first and most important stage of a seven-year program to
         improve and extend the country's highway network which now carries 803 of total
         passenger traffic and 703 of freight.

         PARAGUAY
         HIGHWAY        PROGRAM                         $6 million credit signed October 26, 1961

              The credit will help to finance the cost being incurred by the Paraguayan Govern- ·
         ment for the improvement of the country's most important highway, between the
         capital city of Asuncion and Encarnacion, the second largest town. The highway crosses
         the eastern section of Paraguay, connecting with a number of feeder roads which serve
         a heavily populated area containing some of the country's best farming and cattle-
         raising land. With the exception of a 40-mile section built to all-weather standards with
         the assistance of a World Bank loan in 1951, this is a narrow, dirt or gravel road, sec-
         tions of which are closed during the rainy season. With the assistance of the IDA
         credit, the highway will be widened and given a permanent bituminous surface over the
         remaining 190 miles, making it passable in all seasons; a new two-lane bridge will be
         built over the Tebicuary River where now all vehicles must cross by one primitive ferry.
         The credit will also be used for the purchase of imported maintenance equipment.

                                           NOTE A

Amounts in currencies other than United States dollars have been translated into United
States dollars:
      (i) In the cases of 48 members, at the par values as specified in the "Schedule of Par
          Values'', published by the International Monetary Fund.
     (ii) In the cases of the remaining 14 members (Afghanistan, Bolivia, Chile, China,
          Cyprus, Korea, Liberia, Malaya, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Tunisia and
          Viet-Nam), at the rates used by such members in making payments of subscriptions
          to the Association.
                                           NOTE    B

Pursuant to Article IV, Section 1 (a) these amounts may be used by the Association for ad-
ministrative expenses incurred by the Association in the territories of any Part II member
whose currency is involved and, insofar as consistent with sound monetary policies, in pay-
ment for goods and services produced in the territories of such member and required for
projects financed by the Association and located in such territories; and In addition when and
to the extent justified by the economic and financial situation of the member concerned as de-
termined by agreement between the member and the Association, such currency shall be
freely convertible or otherwise usable for projects financed by the Association and located
outside the territories of the member.
                                           NOTE    C_

The principal disbursed and outstanding on development credits and the accrued service
charge are receivable in freely convertible currencies.

                                           NOTE D

Subscriptions are expressed in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in
effect on January 1, 1960.
                                           NOTE    E

Payment of this portion of the subscriptions of members is due on November 8 in each of
the years 1962 through 1964 as follows: One and one quarter percent of the subscription of
each member is payable annually in gold or freely convertible currency; eighteen percent of
the subscription of each member is payable annually (a) in gold or freely convertible cur-
rency by Part I members and (b) in the currency of the subscribing member by Part II
members.
                                           NOTE    F

Under Article IV, Section 2 each member is required, if the par value of its currency is re-
duced or the foreign exchange value of its currency has in the opinion of the Association
depreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, to maintain the value of
the Association's holdings of its ninety percent currency, including the principal amount of
any notes substituted therefor, and the Association is required if the par value of the mem-
ber's currency is increased, or the foreign exchange value of the member's currency has in the
opinion of the Association appreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories,
to return to the member the increase in the value of such ninety percent currency held by the
Association; provided, however, that the foregoing shall apply only so long as and to the
extent that such currency shall not have been initially disbursed or exchanged for the cur-
rency of another member.
The equivalent of $639,539 is due from 1 member in order to maintain the value of the Asso-
ciation;s holdings of its ninety percent currency as required under Article IV, Section 2.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in terms of United
States currency, the financial position of the International Development Association at
June 30, 1962, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the period
from September 24, 1960 (the date when the Articles of Agreement establishing the Asso-
ciation entered into force) to June 30, 1961. Our examination of these statements was made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included review
of the allocation of expenses incurred jointly with the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as
we considered necessary.
