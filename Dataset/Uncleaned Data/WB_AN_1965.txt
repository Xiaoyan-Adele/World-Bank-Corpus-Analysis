September 27, 1965
My dear Mr. Chairman:
In accordance with Section 10 of the By-Laws of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and Section 2 of the By-Laws of the International
Development Association, I have been authorized by the Executive Directors of the
Bank and the Association to submit to the Boards of Governors this Annual Report
for the fiscal year July 1, 1964 to June 30, 1965.
The first section of the Report surveys the various activities of the Bank and the
Association in the fiscal year, and is followed by the customary Appendices, including
the financial statements as of June 30, 1965, and the Administrative Budgets for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966. A second section of the Report surveys recent
trends in the world economy and discusses current problems of development finance.
The Report concludes with an Annex giving a Country-by-country summary of Bank
and IDA lending and technical assistance.
Sincerely yours,
George D. Woods

istan to help finance the construction and equipment of
seven vocational schools at the secondary level. By June
30, 1965, total educational financing by the Bank and IDA
amounted to more than $52 million.
FINANCING FOR INDUSTRY
Since 1962, IFC has acted for the World Bank group in
considering proposals for organizing or strengthening
industrial development finance companies, predominantly
private institutions which provide both financial and tech-
nical assistance for the expansion of existing industrial
enterprises and the establishment of new ones. During the
fiscal year under review, IFC was assigned responsibility
for overseeing all industrial projects to be financed by the
Bank, the Association or the Corporation.
By June 30, 1965, action was nearly completed by gov-
ernments to amend the Articles of Agreement of both the
Bank and the Corporation, allowing the Bank to lend to
IFC up to four times the Corporation's capital and surplus
without governmental guarantees. The amendments will
add about $400 million to IFC's potential resources for
JR                                                       lending to private industry in the developing member
countries, further enhancing the Corporation's role as the
group's irnstrument for industrial development.
A large part of the World Bank group's financing for in-
dustry during the fiscal year was in support of industrial
development finance companies, which have become a
highly successful mechanism for the development of pri-
vate industrial enterprises, especially of small and medium
size. Beginning in 1950, the Bank group has assisted 19
finance companies in 17 countries with commitments to-
taling $383 million. With these and other resources, the
companies have provided in the neighborhood of $1,000
million for the development of industry. In addition, some
have helped to develop the capital market for industrial
securities by entering into standby or underwriting ar-
rangements in support of new industrial issues.
During 1964/65, the Bank lent $50 million to the Indus-
trial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, $15 mil-
lion to the China Development Corporation and $14 mil-
lion to the Industrialization Fund of Finland; IDA extended
two credits totaling $15 million to the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of Turkey; in the Ivory Coast, IFC subscribed
some $200,000 of the capital of the new Banque Ivoi-
rienne de D6veloppement Industriel, and in Spain it dou-
bled its share subscription to the Banco del Desarrollo Eco-
n6mico Espanol to a total of about $585,000.
Near the close of the fiscal year, the Bank made a loan of
$100 million to the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (the Southern
Italy Development Fund) to assist the development of in-
dustry in Southern Italy. The funds will be re-lent by the
Cassa to three special credit institutes which lend to in-

WASHINGTON, D.C.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in
terms of United States currency, the financial position of International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development at June 30, 1965, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with that of the preceding year. Our examination of these statements was made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such
tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered
necessary.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in
terms of United States currency, the financial position of International Development As-
sociation at June 30, 1965, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent
with that of the preceding year. Our examination of these statements was made in accord-
ance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included review of the
allocation of expenses incurred jointly with International Bank for Reconstruction and De-
velopment, tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we
considered necessary.
