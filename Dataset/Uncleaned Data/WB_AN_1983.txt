In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through G present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development at June 30, 1983 and 1982, and the results of its operations and the changes in its finan-
cial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. Our examinations of the statements were made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such
other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through G present fairly, in terms
of special drawing rights (SDRs). the financial position of the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development at June 30, 1983 and 1982, and the results of its operations and the changes in its
financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting princi-
ples consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with gen-
erally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

:On August 9, 1979, the Executive Directors decided that the Association's commitment authority not be reduced by the amount of deficits in fiscal
year 1980 or during the period of the sixth replenishment of the Association's resources. In orderto reflect this decision, the resources available for
commitment have been increased bythe amount ofthe accumulated loss forthe periodJuly 1,1979 toJune 30, 1983.
2 Includes sixteen development credits totaling $51 5,906,000 approved by the Association subject to the availability of additional commitment author-
ity. At June 30, 1983 the amount of $515,210,000 of additional commitment authority has become available but has not been allocated to specific
development credits; as a result, the aggregate amount of development credits subject to availability of commitment authority has decreased to
$696,000. The difference of $1,140,519,000 between this amount and $1,141,215,000 is primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations in the
value, in terms of current United States dollars, of resources expressed in other member currencies and provided in prior fiscal years. The value of
these resources at any given time may be greater or less than the development credits committed against them, since these development credits are
denominated in United States dollars or special drawing rights. If a shortfall should make it necessary, repayments on earlier development credits
would be available for meeting the Association's disbursement obligations. Resources provided under the sixth replenishment may also be used for
this purpose, if necessary.

President and Board of Governors,
International Development Association
We have examined the financial statements of the International Development Association appearing
in Appendices A through F. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with gen-
erally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
As described in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the notes to these financial
statements, management believes that it would be consistent with General Counsel's opinion with respect
to the valuation of certain of the Association's subscriptions and supplementary resources, to also sub-
stitute the special drawing right (SDR) for the 1960 dollar as the measure of the development credit
repayment obligations of the Association's borrowers. However, this would require approval of the
Executive Directors and involve other changes in the development credit agreements. Accordingly,
until these events have occurred, the repayment obligations will not be revalued.
In our opinion, subject to the effects on the financial statements of such adjustments, if any, as might
have been required had the outcome of the uncertainty referred to in the preceding paragraph been
known, the financial statements examined by us present fairly, in terms of United States dollars, the
financial position of the International Development Association at June 30, 1983 and 1982, the results
of its operations and the changes in its resources available for commitment for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through E present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, and special drawing rights (SDRs), the financial position of the Special Fund
Administered by the International Development Association at June 30, 1983, and the results of its
operations and the changes in its resources available for commitment for the period from December 13,
1982 (date of inception) to June 30, 1983, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing stan-
dards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing proce-
dures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
