NOTE: These figures are based on data available at the time of Board Presentation, as subsequently modified by year-end
revisions. The number of cofinancings by source is greater than the number of projects cofinanced because many projects are
confinanced from more than one source.
This amount represents private cofinancings as reflected in the financing plans at the time of Board approval of the A-loan. It
does not represent private cofinancing loans actually signed in the fiscal year. See Table 1-5 for private loan amounts placed in
fiscal 1984.
This amount does not include a further $47.5 million equivalent of IBRD funding authorized for B-loans signed in fiscal 1984
in respect of projects approved by the Board in previous years. The IBRD has also approved in fiscal 1984 a contingent

for the continued growth of the IBRD's lending                        i            ;
operations and are supplemented by the other
principal financial resources of the IBRD,
which are its paid-in capital, accumulated earn-
ings, and loan repayments. Total borrowings by
the IBRD in fiscal 1984, including incremental
discount notes outstanding on June 30, 1984,
amounted to the equivalent of $9,831 million.
While this amount of borrowings was some $461
million under fiscal 1983 totals, it does not in-

During the fiscal year, the IBRD continued to
engage in numerous currency-hedged transac-          0
tions, commonly referred to as currency swaps.
These transactions are viewed as a means of
increasing the IBRD's access to low nominal-
cost currencies. In fiscal 1984, the IBRD ex-      C              i
ecuted forty-four currency-swap transactions
aggregating $1,299 million; $893 million was
swapped into Swiss francs, $306 million into
Deutsche mark, $59 million into Netherlands
guilders, and $41 million into Austrian schill-
ings. From the beginning of fiscal 1982. the
IBRD has engaged in currency-swap transac-
tions which, by the end of fiscal 1984, aggre-
gated $3,788 million.
Swaps have been employed to lower the costs
of funds available for its lending operations.        i
They have enabled the IBRD to increase its
access to low nominal-cost currencies beyond

'On August 9, 1979, the Executive Directors decided that the Association's commitment authority not be reduced by the amount of deficits in fiscal year 1980
or during the period of the sixth replenishment of the Association's resources. In order to reflect this decision, the resources available for commitment have
teen increased by the amount of the accumulated loss for the period July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1984.
2The net shortfall in resources of $854,102,000 shows above nepresents (i) $51,001,000 of subscriptions and contributions to the sixth replenishment and the
FY84 Account available and not yet used for commitment as of June 30, 1984 and (ii) a shortfall of $905,103,000 which is primarily attributable to exchange
rate fluctuations in the value, in terms of current United States dollars, of resources expressed in other member currencies and provided in prior fiscal years.
The value of these resources at any given time may be greater or less than the development credits committed against them, since these development credits
are denominated in United States dollars or special drawing rights.

International Development Association
We have examined the financial statements of the International Development Association appearing
in Appendices A through F. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records
and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
As described in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the notes to the
financial statements, no decision has been made as to the standard of value to be substituted for the
1960 dollar in determining the repayment obligations of certain of the Association's development
credits. Pending a decision on this matter. the financial statements have been presented using
$1.20635 as the standard of value in measuring these development credit repayment obligations. The
amount of any adjustment that might be required as a result of a decision on the standard of value
cannot be determined.
In our opinion, subject to the effects on the financial statements of such adjustments, if anv, as might
have been required had the outcome of the uncertainty referred to in the preceding paragraph been
known, the financial statements examined by us present fairly, in terms of United States dollars, the
financial position of the International Development Association at June 30. 1984 and 1983. the
results of its operations and the changes in its resources available for commitment for the vears then
ended in conformity with generallv accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis after
restatement for the change, with which we concur, in the method of accounting for translation of
development credits denominated in special drawing rights as described in the Summary of Signifi-

International Development Association
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through E present fairly, in
terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Special Fund Administered by the Inter-
national Development Association at June 30, 1984 and 1983, and the results of its operations and
the changes in its resources available for commitment for the year ended June 30, 1984 and for the
period from December 13, 1982 (date of inception) to June 30, 1983, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were
made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests
of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.
