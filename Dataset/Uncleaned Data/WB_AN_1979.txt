however, in view of the Bank's character as an international
organization and its related financial policies, which are
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting and
Related Policies (Translation of Currencies) and in Note A,
the Bank does not deem the application of this accounting
principle to be appropriate in the circumstances, and we
concur with this conclusion.
In our opinion, the financial statements examined by us
present fairly, in terms of United States currency, the finan-
cial position of International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development at June 30, 1979 and 1978, and the results of
its operations and the changes in its financial position for the
years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied.
