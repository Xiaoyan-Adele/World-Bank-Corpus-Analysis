On the financial side, the IBRD borrowed the
equivalent of $10,883 million in the world's finani-
cial markets. Its net income was $1,187 million.
And, at the end of the fiscal year, the executive
board approved two initiatives that provide bor-
rowers flexibility in determinling the currency com-
position of their 16RI loans. One permits borrowers
to select loans in a single currency for new loan
commitments without volume restriction. The
other allows borrowers to convert the terms of
their existing currency-pool loans to the offered
currency of their choice.
During the fiscal year, Bosnia and Herzegovina
fulfilled the required formalities to succeed to the
membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia as a member of the uIRD. Brunei
Darussalam became a member of the iIFRD Olo
October 10, 1995, increasinig the IMRD's membership

At the end of the fiscal year, action was peniding

Bosnia and Herzegovina also fulfilled the re-
quired formalities to succeeed to the membership
of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugosla-

ship of IDA to 1 59.

Development Effectiveness
The board Committee on Development
Effectiveness continued urging management to
develop indicators of development effective-
ness, or development impact, that could be ap-
plied to operations ex ante. This would consti-
tute one major follow-up to the Task Force on
Portfolio Management, and it woould help in ef-
forts to design higher-quality projects.
The comnPittee is also interested in having
the lFC develop indicators to measure the devel-
opmental effectiveness of its investmenits.
Supervision and portfolio evaluation and
management are other areas of major follow-up
to that task force report, and the board now re-
views it via an "'Annlual Report on Portfolio Per-
formance." It has expressed satisfaction that ac-
tive portfolio restructuring and management
have become increasingly employed by Bank
staff and country officials.
New Auditors
On the recommendation of the Audit Com-
mittee, the board in fiscal 1995 decided to peri-
odically rotate external auditors. In fiscal 1996,
procedures for getting bids from five interna-
tional firms were decided. The actual bidding
process and the selection of the new auditor are
expected to take place in fiscal 1997.

Public Information Center
Since the Bank's disclosure-of-informationi
policy was endorsed by the executive directors
in August 1993, the Public Information Center
(Pic) has worked to make available a wider
range of operational information-formerly
available only to official users-to a wider audi-
ence, in user-friendly ways. The Pic provides in-
formation related to Bank-assisted projets, in-
cluding project-preparation documents,
environmental studies, and evaluations. The
PIc's aim is to support accountability and trans-
parencv of the Bank's operations.
The PIC continued to expand its activites in
fiscal 1996. Several new initiatives were taken

Challenges Ahead
Several global and regional economic and so-
cial processes underlie the present situation and
future outlook for East Asia and Pacific. The
processes include:
* rising integration of international markets
with growing trade, capital flows, and interna-
tional migration;
* the transition by several countries from cen-
tral planning to market-based economies and its
effect on two thirds of the region's population
who are entering the international market via
trade integration;
* the transition from predominantly rural to
predominantly urhan societies. In the early
1 990s, only about 500 million East Asians lived

Consensus Building
Building conselnsus among project beneficia-
ries through various communication tools-
seminars, meetings, media coverage-is an im-
portant aspect of improving ownership of, and
local commitment to, projects. In many lending
and nonlending activities, the Bank has followed
a participatory approach, involving large num-
bers of stakeholders in the preparation of eco-
nomic and sector work and in project design.
The object is to broaden and deepen 'owner-

pact of the Bank's activities. The preparation of

The Bank's poverty assessment for Pakistan, for
example, was the sole subject of a number of
seminars that brought together government of-
ficials, nongovernment organization (NGO) rep-

improving rural water supply. Over the longer

contribute to IDA-IO, thereby increasing its
commitment authority by an additional SDR273
million. Only one donor, Kuwait, had not vet
notified the Association of its participation in
IDA- Oby the end of fiscal 1996.
Other resources made available during the
vear included the transfer of SDR 161 million
from the IBRD'S fiscal 1995 net income and SDR
942 million of commitment authority against
current and future repayments of past credits.
Of the latter amount, sDR800 million is for
ordinary credits, and another sDR 142 million is
for the Fifth Dimension Program. Therefore,
the total available resoures for the entire IDA-1(I
period increased to SDR 14,895 million in fiscal
1996.
Against these resources, the Association made
IDA-I 0 commitments of SDR4,616 million during
fiscal 1996. Of this amount, 40 percent went to
Africa, 26 percent to South Asia, 17 percent to
East Asia and Pacific, 7 percent to Europe and
Central Asia, 6 percent to Latin America and
the Caribbean, and 5 percent to the Middle
East and North Africa.
IDA'S commitmentfee. Every year, the level of
commitment fee is set by the executive direc-
tors based on an annual review of IDA'S financial
position. The commitment fee for fiscal 1997
was set at 0 percent for all IDA credits. IDA'S
commitment fee has been 0 percent from fiscal
1989 through fiscal 1996.
Special Fuind teimnination. In May 1996, the
executive directors approved the termination of

In our opinion, the finanicial statements appearing on pages 168 through 195 of this Report present
fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Interna-
tionial Bank for Reconistruction and Development at June 3(0, 1)996 and 1995, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years theni ended in conformity wvith generally accepted account-
ing principles in the United States and with Internationial Accounting Standards. These finan-cial state-
nients are the responsibility of management of the Interniationial Bank for Reconstruction and
Development; oui responsibility is to express an opinioni on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conlducted our- audits of these statements in accordance w!ith generally accepted auditing
standards, including Internationial Standards on Auditing, which requir-e that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonahle assurance about wxhether the finanicial statemernts are free of material mis-
statement. An audit includes examining, on1 a test basis, evidence supporting the amounlts and disclo-
sures in the finanicial statements, assessinig the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall finanicial statement presentationi. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Powet- and Subscr-iptions and Contributions as of lune 30, 1996, and the related special purpose Statements
of Chaniues in AcCumulated Sur-plus and of Cash Flows for the years ended June 3(J, 1'996 and 1995,

appear on pages 1 98 througIh 21 7 of this Report. These finaicial statements are the responsibility of man-

We conducted OuI audits in accordance \w'ith gener-ally accpted auditing standards, inicfcling Interniatiolial
StaLidaL-ds on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assuranice about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examiiinig, on a test basis, evidenc,e supporting the amounits and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audclit also includes assessinig the accounting principles used and significait estimates made by managemilelt,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a rea-
sonable basis for our opinioi.
The special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and applications of'develop-

c. Countries are eligilble !for Iozi on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b7) lick oj credituorthiniess. The operattiotal cutofffor ID.I eligi-
bilit for FY97 is a 199  GNP pper capita of $905, using Atlas methodology'. 1; receitve 0m5 resources, cou,,tries also meet tests ofperfor-
mnance. In exceptioial circumstances, i0A extends eligibility temporarill to coun)itres that are above the operational cutoff and are
unndertaking major adjustmnent efforts but are not creditworth-y for IhRD lending A4n exception hIns also been made for small island econ-
omies (see friotnote l).
d During the n)A- N perod (FY97 99), an esxception to the G Nr per capita operational cutofffor i.s eligibility ($905 Jor FY97) has
been made for specific snall isaind economies, Uhich otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistanice because they
lack credituwor-thiness. For such countries, ir)o fui nding is consideredt case by case for the financing of projects ntid adjustment progna ms
designed to strengthen credituworthiness.
