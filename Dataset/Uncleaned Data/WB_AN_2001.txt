Message from the President of the World Bank and
Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors
The poverty reduction agenda has advanced signifi-
cantly over the past year, with development partners  i
coming together as never before. We must now build      I
on that momentum. Progress in reducing poverty  \
remains slow too many girls still do not go to  _ 
school, too many children die before the age of five,  '             ,         ,   O  .
and too many poor people lack opportunity                       e\       A .               '
The urgency for action is pressing. Nearly half  ,.'
of the world's people live on less than $2 a day, and  '<!l,
their numbers will grow in the next 25 years, as     7                                          -=
nearly two billion more people are added to develop-
ing countries' populations. The stakes are high, as  /
poverty touches all-and drives prospects for no less T
than global peace How can we scale up successes ,
enough to meet the international development goals  -
for 2015? (See page 4 ) Only with concerted action
can we make a difference.

a To better capture the evolving nature of Bank operations, the Bank's sector classification system is reviewed and changed as appropriate In fiscal 2000, two new
sector categories were created (Economic Policy and Private Sector Development) and one sector category was dropped (Industry) Economic Policy comprises oper-
ations that support macroeconomic poiicy, trade, and other economic and institutional reforms It includes structural adjustment operations previously assigned to
Multisector and some operations previousiy assigned to Finance Private Sector Development comprises operations dealing with the business environment, private
infrastructure, small scale enterprise, and privatization issues As such, it includes some operations previously assigned to Industry and to Public Sector Management
Other operations previously included under Industry have been assigned to the Public Sector Management sector In addition, a few individual operations approved
in fiscal 1998-99 were reassigned, including a fiscal 1999 project from Agriculture to Water Supply and Sanitation
b This column shows lending by sector, based on a classification by major loan component The example of a $100 million public sector loan,with components
aimed at addressing environmental, financial, and social protection needs, serves as an illustration In the case of loan-by-loan classification, the full amount of the
loan appears in the Public Sector Management sector, in the component classification, the full amount is split among the four sectors-Public Sector Management,
Environment, Finance, and Social Protection As a result, total lending of $1,882 7 million for Social Protection in the component classification is the sum of all
social protection components within loans approved in fiscal 2001

Particularly noteworthy are quality improvements in
the Africa region, which reflect in part IDA's growing
effort to focus new lending on countries with good

ensuring more effective use of aid is the greater
attention, Bank-wide, to safeguard and fiduciary
policies. Highlights include an improved tracking

Over five years, BCA-and Cape Verde's financial system as a
whole-have been transformed. The two state-owned banks
(including BCA) have been privatized and, combined with the
arrival of foreign banks, competition has intensified in the
banking sector; bank governance has improved; the culture has
changed, with a civil service mentality progressively replaced
with banking skills; and modern and electronic-based banking
has been introduced. In addition, banks have become more
profitable, have better-quality balance sheets, and have
improved their services to customers.

HIV/AIDS: Prevention Is Vital
Today 36 million people are infected
with HIV; more than 21 million have died
of AI DS since the 1980s; and over 13
million children have been orphaned by
the disease.
As a cosponsor of the Joint United
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), the World Bank has commit-
ted more resources to HIV/AIDS in fiscal
2001 than in any previous year. Other
sections of this Annual Report discuss
the Bank's support to Africa (page 27)
and work with partners (page 103).
In this chapter, the "Fast Facts" box in
each section shows the number of per-
gD H -,,,, U1- '   DL ,                                       sons living with HIV/AIDS.* While the

cost less than $3 per capita with preva-
lence rates below 5 percent, costs would
quadruple to $12 per capita at preva-
lence rates of 15 percent. UNAIDS esti-
mates that a basic HIV/AIDS program in
all developing countries would cost at
least $9.2 billion per year, six times the
current level of investment.

n a Precise figures not available
a World Bank Atlas methodology, per capita GNI (gross national income, formerly GNP) figures are in 2000 U S dollars
b Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness The operational cutoff for IDA eligibility for fiscal 2002 is a
2000 GNI per capita of $885, using Atlas methodology To receive IDA resources, countries also meet tests of performance In exceptional circumstances, IDA
extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD
lending An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote c)
c During the IDA-12 period (fiscal 2000-02), an exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($885 for fiscal 2002) has been made for
some small island economies, which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness For such countries,
IDA funding is considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness
