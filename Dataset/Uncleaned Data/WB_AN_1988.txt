President and Board of Governors,
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 158 through 174 of this Report present fairly,
in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development at June 30, 1988 and 1987, and the results of its operations and the
changes in its financial position for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of management of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the account-
ing principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

Commitment Resources               179
a. Surpluses and deficits in resources under fully committed replenishments are primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations in value, in terms of
current US dollars, of resources expressed in currencies other than US dollars. The value of these resources at any given time may be greater or less than
the development credits committed against them, since these development credits are denominated in US dollars or SDRs.
IDA reviews periodically the resource posftion under fully committed replenishments and, if necessary, allocates portions of the resources that become
available for commitment during the period to those replenishments. For IDA, these allocations will include income from operations until it equals the
cumulative losses from operations for the period July 1,1979 to December 31,1984, totaling $353,815,000. Losses incurred during that period were not
reduced from commitment authority in accordance with the decision of the Executive Directors that IDA's commitment authority not be reduced by the
amount of deficits during the sixth replenishment period. The decision reflected the expectation that future income would be available to reduce these
losses. All income earned subsequent to that period, amounting to $262,936,000 at June 30, 1988, has been allocated for this purpose.

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing on pages 177 through 192 of this Report present fairly,
in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the International
Development Association, Special Fund Administered by the International Development Association, and
the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa Administered by the International Development Association at
June 30, 1988 and 1987, and the changes in their commitment resources and their liquid funds for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements
are the responsibility of management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion
expressed above.
