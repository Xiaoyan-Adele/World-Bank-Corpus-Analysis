This Annual Report, which covers the period from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011, has been prepared by the Executive Directors of both the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA)—collectively known as the World Bank—in accordance with the respective bylaws of the two institutions.
Robert B. Zoellick, President of IBRD and IDA, and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, has submitted this report, together with the accompanying administrative budgets
and audited ?nancial statements, to the Board of Governors.

Annual reports for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) are published separately.

POSTCRISIS DIRECTIONS


REALTIME RESPONSE TO RENEWED CHALLENGES
The impact of the worst ?nancial and economic crisis since the Great
Depression ebbed in 2010, as world output increased by an estimated
3.9 percent, led by strong domestic demand in developing countries.
The bounce-back is projected to slow to 3.3 percent in 2011 before pick-
ing up to 3.6 percent in 2012.
    In contrast to many high-income countries and countries in Europe and
Central Asia where growth remains sluggish, most developing countries
have recovered—or are in the process of recovering—to precrisis levels.
Rising South-South investments, particularly investments originating in Asia,
have played an important role in the rebound. The economies of Brazil,
China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation
are poised to account for more than half of all global growth by 2025. They
will help drive growth in lower-income countries through cross-border
commercial and ?nancial transactions, according to a new World Bank re-
port, Global Development Horizons.

Education
As one of the largest external funders of education in the developing world,
the Bank is a key player in global eﬀorts to reach the education MDGs—
universal primary completion and gender parity—and to achieve quality
learning for all. The Bank invested more than $1.7 billion in education this
?scal year and currently manages a portfolio of $11.2 billion. At the UN
Summit on the MDGs in September 2010, the Bank pledged to increase its
IDA resources for basic education by $750 million over the following ?ve
years to assist countries not on track to reach the goals by 2015, particularly
in Africa and South Asia. (See http://worldbank.org/education.)
    Thanks in part to Bank support, three-quarters of the countries in East
Asia and Paci?c, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the
Caribbean have met or are on track to meet the education MDGs. During                 At a village school in rural Mali, students gather to immerse themselves in

HIV/AIDS
The Bank is actively engaged in helping countries halt and then begin
to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. A total of $108 million of
new lending has been designated for operations that support HIV/AIDS-
related prevention, treatment, and mitigation in Argentina, Burkina Faso,
Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, Mozambique, Niger, and Swaziland. The
Bank developed ?ve analytical products that strengthened national pro-

evidence-based national strategies and action plans.

    The recent crises have added momentum to the Bank’s emerging re-

2010 evaluation of work in this sector. Noting that the crucial question
concerns what steps would further strengthen eﬀectiveness, IEG high-

techniques, water supply, and market access, among other things. Second,
agriculture-based economies warrant special attention. Third, the Bank is
uniquely positioned to exploit synergies between public and private pro-

World Bank Assistance
The Bank delivered $7.1 billion to Africa in ?scal 2011. Support included
$7 billion from IDA and $56 million from IBRD.
    In response to the opportunity for Africa to transform itself and improve
the lives of its people, the Bank has developed an ambitious 10-year strat-
egy, Africa’s Future and the World Bank’s Support to It, which could help the
region’s economies take oﬀ the way the economies of Asia did 30 years
ago. The new approach has two pillars—competitiveness and employ-
ment, and vulnerability and resilience—which rest on a foundation of
strengthened governance and public sector capacity. The strategy reverses

Building Resilience to Natural Hazards and Climate Change
Increasing resilience to extreme climate events, rising sea levels, and other
natural hazards is a major medium-term challenge for the region, which
has experienced more than 70 percent of the world’s natural disasters
and sustained 82 percent of total disaster fatalities since 1997. The Bank’s
work encompasses analytical and advisory services in disaster and climate
change risk assessments, the development of risk ?nancing options, and
risk-mitigation policies. This year the tragedies of the ﬂoods and cyclone in
Australia, and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, required mutual learn-
ing and understanding between the Bank and its donors.

DRIVEN BY RESULTS
The World Bank Group’s mission is to lift and keep people out of poverty.
Through ?nancial assistance, policy and institutional support, and techni-
cal knowledge, it helps people across the world build a better future for
themselves, their families, and their countries. At the heart of the Bank’s
approach to delivering programs and policy advice is a strong focus on
results.

A Dynamic Framework for Capturing Results
The Bank has made signi?cant advances in recent years in the ways it mea-
sures, monitors, and reports on results. Its commitment to results-based
assistance takes the following forms:
     • All Bank country assistance strategies are now results based, with re-

       ments, donors, and stakeholders to collaborate more eﬀectively to

To respond to changing development needs and the demand from client
countries, and building on experience to date, the Bank proposed a new

the design and implementation of their own development programs.
