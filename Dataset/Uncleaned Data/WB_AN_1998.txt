MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF
EXEC-UTIVE DIRECTORS
Last year's Annual Report described a
year of change and renewal. This year
many of those changes have begun to
bear fruit. Disbursements and quality are
up; projects at risk are down; and our
clients are reporting improvements
across the institution-from more client
responsiveness to more humility.
This year has seen further changes: the
implementation of the Cost Effective-
ness Review; further decentralization of
decisionmaking powers to the field; a
new budgeting and planning process for
<   the first time linked to strategic objec-
tives; and the introduction of a new hu-
man resources policy designed to end
the traditional divisions between head-
quarters and local staff in the field and
between regular and nonregular staff.
Much remains to be done. But the
progress of the last twelve months pro-
vides us with a solid foundation on
which to build. None of this would
have been possible without the whole-
hearted support and guidance of our
executive board.

BOX 1. THE STRATEGIC COMPACT: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES
One and a half years after member countries approved the Strategic Compact-the World Bank's ongoing
effort to strengthen its development effectiveness through a comprehensive renewal program-progress is apparent
in a number of key areas. There is clear evidence of improved quality and timeliness and an increase in demand
for products and services. These results are underscored by emerging positive feedback from clients through, for
example, client surveys. But a lot remains to be done. Internally, staff are still adjusting to matrix management
and other new ways of working, and there is a need to strengthen trust and teamwork. Externally, it is impera-
tive to sustain the emerging progress on quality, delivery, and results for clients. The compact is a work in
progress. The challenge of implementation remains.

BOX 2. INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT TARGETS
Recent United Nations coniferences have adopted several goaZs for the twentv-first century The Bank is
helping to achieve the goals and will monitor them in the countries it assists. The goals are to:
* reduce by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015;
* achieve universal primary education in all countries by 2015;
* achieve gender equality in primary and secondary education by 2005;
* reduce infant and child mortality by two thirds, and maternal deaths by three quarters, by 2015;
a provide universal access to reproductive health services by 2015; and
* reverse current global and niation al loss of environmental resources by 2015.
Meeting goals as ambitious and important as these will require significant efforts by the global community.

Meeting clients' changing needs
The East Asian financial crisis precipitated a
wholesale restructuring of the composition of
the Bank's fiscal 1998 lending program: ten ad-
justment and/or technical assistance and emer-
gency operations were added, while four invest-
ment loans were deferred to fiscal 1999. Strong
efforts were launched to ensure timely imple-
mentation of projects and maintenance of-the
portfolio quality. Improvement measures were
initiated, including selective project restructur-
ing in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam; cancella-
tion of sluggish project components; and rebal-
ancing of project costing in the face of shortages
in counterpart funding.
The regional office continued to maintain a
strong portfolio through intensified supervision,
increasingly undertaken by field offices; six of
the region's eight country management units
were operating in the field at the end of the fis-
cal year.'0 A flatter management structure was
adopted at headquarters, with eleven functional
units responsible for delivering services to client
countries, managing the project portfolio, and
preparing new projects jointly with clients. In
fiscal 1998 the Bank's new management and or-
ganizational structure allowed closer interaction
with clients and faster responses to the urgent
needs on the ground, including dealing with
natural disasters.

b. Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness. The operational czutofffor IDA eligibil-
ity for FY99 is a 1997 GNP per capita of US$925, using Atlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries also meet tests of perfor-
mance. In exceptional circumstances, IDA extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are
undertakiing major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD lending An exception has also been made for small island econ-
omies (see below) -
c During the IDA-u period (FY97-99), an exception to the GNP per capita operational cutofffor mA eligibility ($925 for FY99) has been
made for some small island economies, which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack cred-
itworthiness. For such countries, IDA funding is considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment prograins designed to
strengthen creditworthiness.                                                                     APPENDIX SIX  155

Management's Discussion and Analysis
1. Financial Overview
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international organization. established in 1945 and
owned by its member countries. IBRD's main goals are promoting sustainable economic development and reducing poverty.
It pursues these goals primarily by providing loans, guarantees and related technical assistance for projects and programs in
its developing member countries. IBRD's ability to intermediate funds from international capital markets for lending to its
developing member countries is an important element in achieving its development goals. IBRD's objective is not to
maximize profit, but to earn adequate net income to ensure its financial strength and to sustain its development activities on an
ongoing basis.
The table below presents selected financial data for the last five fiscal years:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 185



The financial strength of IBRD is based on the support it receives from its shareholders and on its array of financial policies
and practices. Shareholder support for IBRD is reflected in the capital backing it has received from its members and in the
record of its borrowing members in meeting their debt-service obligations to it. IBRD's financial policies and practices have
led it to build reserves, to diversify its funding sources, to hold a large portfolio of liquid investments and to limit a variety of
risks, including credit, market and liquidity risks.
IBRD's principal assets are its loans to member countries. The bulk of IBRD's outstanding loans are priced on a cost pass-
through basis, in which the cost of funding the loans - and hence the benefits of IBRD's intermediation efficiency - are passed
through to the borrower, plus a fixed spread of 50 basis points. During FY 1992 - FY 1998 IBRD provided waivers of a
portion of commitment charges and interest to eligible borrowers.
From year to year MBRD's net income is affected by a nunber of factors, including the level of nonaccrual loans, changes in
interest rates (which flow through with a lag to the pass-through lending rates) and the level of the lending rates (which
determine the earnings on equity funding loans). IBRD holds its assets and liabilities primarily in U.S. dollars, Deutsche mark
and Japanese yen. IBRD mitigates its exposure to currency exchange rate risks by matching the currencies of its assets,
liabilities and reserves; however, reported income is affected by exchange rate movements. The increasing strength of the
U.S. dollar, IBRD's reporting currency, has reduced assets, liabilities and reported net income during the last three fiscal
years. This financial statement reporting effect does not impact IBRD's risk bearing and earning capacity.
IBRD's primary consideration in the allocation of net income is the adequacy of its reserves. In recent years IBRD has had
sufficient net income to allow it to fund significant transfers to the International Development Association (IDA), the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative Trust Fund and other development priorities of its shareholders.
During FY 1998 IBRD experienced unprecedented growth in its loan disbursements and commitments, prompted primarily by
the financial crisis in East Asia and adjustment lending in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This loan growth has reduced
IBRD's reserves-to-loans ratio from 14.49% at June 30, 1997 to 14.06% at June 30, 1998. However, the implications of this
reduction in the reserves-to-loans ratio for IBRD's risk-bearing capacity depend on changes in credit risks in the loan
portfolio. On July 30, 1998, to ensure that the reserves-to-loans ratio continues to be adequate, IBRD's Executive Directors
approved the allocation of $750 million of FY 1998 net income to reserves. The maturity of high interest, fixed rate loans
from the early 1980s and, more broadly, the effects of lower lending rates on net income via the investment in loans of IBRD
members' equity (free funds), contribute to an outlook of declining net income. IBRD continues to evaluate additional
measures for enhancing ils risk bearing capacity.
2. Development Activities
IBRD offers a range of instruments to its member countries to meet their development needs. These financial instruments fall
into two primary categories, loans and guarantees.
Loans
From its establishment through June 30, 1998, IBRD had approved loans totaling $323,449 million to borrowers in 128
countries. The loans held by IBRD, including loans approved but not yet effective, at June 30, 1998 totaled $157,641 million,
of which $106,576 million was disbursed and $51,065 million was undisbursed. Cumulative loan repayments at June 30,
1998, based on exchange rates at the time of disbursement, were $121,421 million.
IBRD's lending operations have conformed generally to five principles derived from its Articles of Agreement (the Articles).
These principles, taken together, seek to ensure that IBRD loans are made to member countries for financially and
economically sound purposes to which those countries have assigned high priority, and that funds lent are utilized as intended.
The five principles are:
(i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterprises in the territories of member
countries. A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the project is located must be
guaranteed as to principal, interest and other charges by the member or its central bank or a comparable agency
of the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the member itself has been obtained in all such cases to date.
(ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member countries.
Projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical, economic, financial,
institutional and environmental soundness.
186 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 1998



(iii) In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment. Decisions to make
loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a country's economic structure, including
assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign exchange to meet debt-service obligations.
(iv) IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's overall
external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under conditions which, in
the opinion of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower. IBRD is intended to promote private investment, not to
compete with it.
(v) The use of loan proceeds is supervised. IBRD makes arrangements to ensure that funds loaned are used only for
authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-effectiveness. This policy
is enforced primarily by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation establishing, to IBRD's satisfaction,
that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of loans are made in conformity with the applicable lending
agreements and (b) to procure goods and services through procedures, including international competitive
bidding, which IBRD judges to be likely to lead to cost-efficient procurement.
Within the scope permitted by the Articles, these policies must necessarily be developed and adjusted in light of experience
and changing conditions.
The process of identifying and appraising a project and approving and disbursing a loan often extends over several years. The
appraisal of projects is caTried out by IBRD's operational staff (engineers, financial analysts, economists and other sector and
country specialists). With minor exceptions, all loans must be approved by the IBRD's Executive Directors. Loan
disbursements are subject to the fulfillment of conditions set out in the loan agreement. IBRD is in the process of revising its
financial project management and disbursement procedures with the intention of making them more efficient and effective,
through the Loan Administration Change Initiative. During project implementation IBRD staff with experience in the sector
or the country involved periodically visit project sites to review progress, monitor compliance with IBRD policies and assist
in resolving any problems that may arise. Subsequent to completion the project is evaluated to determine the extent to which
its major objectives were met. Similar appraisal, approval, supervision and evaluation procedures apply in the case of IBRD
structural and sectoral adjustment and other non-project loans.
Lending Instruments
IBRD lendling may take the form of any of the following instruments:
hnvestmext Lending
IBRD has several products that support investment activities, either discrete projects or programs of investments. These loans
broadly fall into the following categories:
*   Specific Investment Loans fund the creation of new productive assets or economic, social, and institutional
infrastructure or their rehabilitation to full capacity.
o   Sector Investment and Maintenance Loans are designed to bring investments, policies, and performance in
specific sectors or subsectors in line with agreed economic priorities.
* Financial Intermediary Loans support the development of financial institutions and provide funds to be
channeled through intermediaries for general credit or for the development of sectors or subsectors. The
primary objective of these loans is to improve the operational efficiency of financial institutions in a
competitive environment.
*   Emergency Recovery Loans are made to restore assets and productivity immnediately after a major emergency
(such as war, civil disturbance, or natural disaster) that seriously disrupts the country's economy.
*   Technical Assistance Loans are designed to strengthen capacity in entities concerned with policies, strategies
and institutional reforms in such areas as public enterprise reform and divestiture, civil service and judicial
reform, government budgetary management, and the formulation of economic policy.
IBRD's management is also developing a range of new lending instruments. The first of these new products are the
Adaptable Lending (AL) instruments, which include:
* Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs): These are designed to support small, time-sensitive programs to build
capacity, pilot promising initiatives, or to experiment with and develop locally-based models prior to large
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 187



scale interventions. LlLs are modest in size with each loan not exceeding $5 million. Approvals of LlLs are at
the management level rather than at the Executive Director level.
* Adaptable Program Loans (APLs): These are designed to provide for funding of a long-term development
program through a series of operations. Succeeding operations are committed on the basis of satisfactory
performance on agreed milestones, indicators, periodic reviews, and the evaluation of implementation progress
and emerging needs. Authority for approval is with the Executive Directors for the first loan of each program
and the long-term program agreement. Authority for approval of subsequent APLs is with IBRD's management
subject to oversight and review by the Executive Directors.
The introduction of LlLs and APLs was approved by the Executive Directors on September 4, 1997.
A breakdown of IBRD's investment lending approved in FY 1998 and in each of the two preceding fiscal years is as follows:

Adjustment Lending
Most IBRD loans are for specific projects. IBRD also makes adjustment loans designed to support the introduction of basic
changes in economic, financial and other policies of key importance for the economic development of member countries.
Disbursements on these loans are conditional on certain performance objectives. The Executive Directors have agreed that
adjustment lending, excluding debt and debt-service reduction loans, will normally not exceed 25% of total IBRD lending.
As a result of several adjustment and similar loans made by IBRD this fiscal year, 47% of IBRD's lending in FY 1998
consisted of such loans. The Executive Directors considered the matter and are fully aware that, in light of the specific and
unusual financial circumstances in Asia at present, the guideline has been exceeded this fiscal year, and may possibly be
exceeded again in subsequent years. Adjustment loans are broadly classified as follows:
*   Structurai! Adjustnent Loans support specific policy changes and institutional reforms. Agreement on a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework and policy actions that can be monitored on a specific schedule are
required.
+   Sector Adjustrnent Loans support comprehensive policy changes and institutional reforms in major sectors.
They also require agreement on a satisfactory macroeconomic framework and its implementation, and a
specific action program that can be monitored.
*   Rehabilitation Loans provide support for government policy reform programs to assist the private sector where
foreign exchange is required for urgent rehabilitation of key infrastructure and productive facilities.
+   Debt and Debt-Service Reduction Loans assist an eligible, highly-indebted country in financing an approved
debt and debt-service reduction operation on its commercial debt that is designed to reduce the debt to a
manageable level and contribute to a viable medium-term financing plan and the attainment of medium-term
growth objectives.

On rare occasions an IBRD loan will be made for a large, foreign exchange generating project in an IDA-only country. In
these circumstances appropriate risk mitigation measures are incorporated (including off-shore escrow accounts and debt-
service reserves acceptable to IBRD) to ensure that the risks to IBRD are minimized. At June 30, 1998, IBRD had less than
$150 mnillion in outstanding loans for enclave projects.

Financial Terms of Lending Instruments
Any of the previously described instruments can be offered with various financial terms. Presently IBRD offers new loans
with three types of financial terms: multicurrency pool loans, LIBOR-based single currency loans, and fixed rate single
currency loans. This prodluct offering is intended to provide borrowers flexibility to select terms that are compatible with their
debt management strategy and suited for their debt-servicing capability. All loans carry a three- to five-year grace period for
principal and amortize over a period that in most cases ranges from 12 to 20 years.
In general IBRD charges a spread on its outstanding loans of 50 basis points over its average cost of borrowings, with the
exception of the two loans described under "single currency loans" below. In addition, all loans carry a commintment charge of
75 basis points per annumr on undisbursed amounts.
Waivers of a portion of interest owed by all eligible borrowers are in effect and have been for each of the previous seven
fiscal years. Waivers of a portion of the commitment charge owed on undisbursed portion of loans made to or guaranteed by
members are in effect and have been for each of the last nine fiscal years. Further details are provided in the Notes to
Financial Statements-Note C.
Multicurrency Pool Loans
The currency composition of multicurrency pool loans is determined on the basis of a pool, which provides a currency
composition that is the sarne for all loans in the pool. Pursuant to a policy established by the Executive Directors and subject
190 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 1998



to their periodic review, at least 90% of this pool is in fixed currency ratios of one U.S. dollar to 125 Japanese yen to two
Deutsche mark equivalent.
The lending rate on these loans is variable, adjusted every six months to reflect the previous semester average cost of
outstanding borrowings allocated to fund these loans, weighted by the average composition of the pool. IBRD adds its
standard spread of 50 basis points to that average cost.
Loan Conversion Options
In FY 1997 in response to borrower demand for broader currency choice, the Executive Directors approved a policy to offer
currency choice for all IBRD multicurrency pool loans for which the invitation to negotiate was issued by September 1, 1996.
The purpose of this invitation was to provide borrowers the flexibility to amend the terms of their existing multicurrency pool
loans to reflect the offered currency of their choice. Under this offer which extended from September 1, 1996 to June 1,
1998, borrowers had three options: (a) retain the terms of their existing multicurrency pool loans; (b) convert undisbursed
loan amounts to single currency loan (SCL) terms; and (c) convert disbursed loan balances and undisbursed loan amounts (to
the extent not converted to SCL terms) to one of four new single currency pools (SCPs).
Conversion to Single Currency Loan Terms
Aggregate conversions of undisbursed balances through July 1, 1998 to SCL terms were $21,115 million, with U.S. dollars
comprising 79.7% of the total.
Conversion to Single Currency Pools
Single currency pool terms are not available for new commitments. Borrowers selecting conversion to single currency pool
terms had the choice of four different pools (U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, Deutsche mark or Swiss franc). All variable rate
multicurrency pool loans that were converted to single currency pools carry the applicable pool's variable lending rate, reset
semi-annually to reflect the previous semester average cost of outstanding borrowings allocated to fund that pool weighted by
the shares of currencies in the pool, plus the standard spread of 50 basis points.
Aggregating the conversions which took place on the conversion dates of July 1, 1997, January 1, 1998, and July 1, 1998,
borrowers converted U.S. dollar equivalent $48,549 million (of which $615 million was undisbursed) from the multicurrency
pool to single currency pools. Among the four currency choices, conversion to the U.S. dollar SCP loan pool accounted for
85.6% and conversion to the Deutsche mark pool accounted for 14.2 % of the total converted loan volume.
-  Implementation. Given the cost pass-through nature of the loan products, special efforts were taken to ensure
an equitable initial re-allocation of outstanding borrowings to fund the SCPs. This was achieved by allocating
similar debt profiles to each of the currency pools on the basis of overall cost and maturity considerations.
IBRD will reconfigure the currency composition of each pool to at least 90% of the pool's target currency by
July 1, 1999, and maintain it at or above 90% thereafter, subject to available funding and swap access in the
necessary currencies.
*   Lending Rates. Lending rates for the U.S. dollar and Deutsche mark SCP loans for the January 1, 1998 to June
30, 1998 semester were 8.37% and 6.92%, respectively. The U.S. dollar rate of 8.37% is significantly higher
than the 6.54% rate in effect for the July 1 to December 31, 1997 semester. This is because as the U.S. dollar
SCP was converted from a multicurrency pool to a U.S. dollar pool, it involved swapping lower nominal cost
non-U.S. dollar liabilities to U.S. dollar liabilities, thus reflecting the difference in market interest rates
between these currencies and the U.S. dollar. This difference was greatest in the case of Japanese yen where
market interest rates were substantially lower than for U.S. dollars.
Single Currency Loans
Borrowers may select LIBOR-based or fixed rate SCL terms for new loans. IBRD currently offers SCLs in U.S. dollars,
Japanese yen, Deutsche mark, French francs, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and Netherlands guilders and will consider
borrower requests for such loans in other currencies.
LEBOR-based SCLs carry a lending rate that is reset semi-annually. The lending rate consists of a base rate, which is the
prevailing six-month interbank offered rate (LBOR, or PIBOR for French franc denominated SCLs) for the applicable
currency on the loan's rate reset date, plus a spread. The spread consists of: (a) IBRD's average cost margin for funding
allocated to these loans relative to the base rate, and (b) IBRD's standard spread of 50 basis points. These variable rate loans
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 191



are designed to pass through to its borrowers IBRD's funding spread to LIBOR. This spread is set every six months, in
January and July. At June 30, 1998, LIBOR-based SCLs make up 14.1% of the total outstanding loans. At the end of FY
1998, the proportion of outstanding LIBOR-based SCLs denominated in U.S. dollars was 97.3%, with the remaining portion
denomninated in Deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen and other currencies.
IBRD approved and disbursed two LIBOR-based single currency loans to the Republic of Korea in FY 1998 that have non-
standard financial terms. The first, a $3,000 million economic reconstruction loan, carries a 6-month LIBOR interest rate plus
a fixed spread of 100 basis points and has a loan origination charge. The second, a $2,000 million structural adjustment loan,
carries a 6-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed spread of 75 basis points and has a loan origination charge. Neither loan is
eligible for interest waivers.
Fixed rate SCLs carry lending rates that are set on specified semni-annual rate fixing dates for amounts disbursed during the
preceding six months. The lending rate consists of a base rate, which reflects market interest rates for the applicable currency
on the rate-fixing date for the equivalent loan maturity, plus a spread. The spread consists of: (a) IBRD's funding cost margin
relative to the base rate for these loans, (b) a risk premium to compensate IBRD for market risks it incurs in funding these
loans, and (c) IBRD's standard spread of 50 basis points.
SCLs continue to be IBRD's fastest growing loan product, with the outstanding balance more than doubling during FY 1998.
The following table presents a breakdown of IBRD' s loan portfolio by product:

Guarantees
IBRD offers guarantees to its members and in exceptional cases will offer enclave guarantees in IDA-only countries subject to
a limit of $300 million. IBRD guarantees are flexible instruments that provide the credit enhancement required to mobilize
private capital. IBRD's objective in offering guarantees is to help mobilize private funding and to leverage IBRD's
participation in these projects by providing required credit enhancements. IBRD guarantees can be customized to suit varying
country and project circumstances. They can be targeted to mitigate specific risks - generally risks relating to political,
regulatory and government performance - which the private sector is not normally in a position to absorb or manage. Two
types of guarantees are offered:
* Partial risk guarantees cover debt-service defaults that may result from nonperformance of government
obligations. These are defined in the contracts negotiated between the government or a government-sponsored
entity and the private company responsible for implementing the project. The IBRD guarantee is limited to
backing the government's obligations; the obligations of the private company contained in the project
agreements are not covered and thus the private lenders assume the risk of nonperformance by the private
company.
*   Partial credit guarantees are used for private sector projects when there is a need to extend loan maturities, but
not necessarily to cover sovereign contractual obligations. This approach may be most appropriate when the
lenders are not willing to accept the sovereign risk of the host government for a term long enough to meet the
needs of the project. By guaranteeing later maturities, such partial credit guarantees help induce the market to
extend the term to the maximum risk it can bear. The presence of the guarantee may also induce a lower
interest rate.
Each guarantee requires the counter-guarantee of the member government as does any loan not made to a member
government. Guarantees are priced within a limited range to reflect the risks involved, and preparation fees may be charged
where there are exceptional costs involved for IBRD.
IBRD applies the same country creditworthiness and project evaluation criteria for guarantees as it applies for loans. Projects
in any country that is eligible for IBRD lending are eligible for IBRD guarantees. IBRD offers partial credit guarantees and
partial risk guarantees to private investors where the government requests such support and the operation meets other IBRD
determined criteria.
IBRD's exposure at June 30, 1998 on its guarantees (measured as their present value in terms of their first call date) was
$1,501 million. The face value of such guarantees was $2,047 million, of which $371 million was subject to call. IBRD
charges a fee of 25 basis points per annum on its exposure on guarantees. Additional information is provided in the Notes to
Financial Statements-Note C.
IEBRD may also provide partial risk guarantees for export-oriented projects in an IDA-only country (enclave guarantees) if the
project is expected to generate foreign exchange outside the country, and IBRD determines that the country will have
adequate foreign exchange to meet its obligations under the counter-guarantee if the guarantee is called. The government is
expected to use revenue accruing to it from any such project for productive development purposes. A project covered by an
enclave guarantee includes security arrangements with appropriate risk mitigation measures-such as offshore revenue
escrow accounts and debt-service reserves acceptable to IBRD-to minimize IBRD's exposure and the risk of a call on the
guarantee. The annual commitment of enclave guarantees is initially limited to an aggregate guaranteed amount of $300
million.
Lending Limit
Under IBRD's Articles, as applied, the total amount outstanding of callable guarantees, participation in loans and direct loans
made by IBRD may not be increased to exceed the statutory lending limit (the sum of IBRD's subscribed capital, reserves and
surplus.) At June 30, 1998, outstanding loans and callable guarantees totaled $106,947 million, or 52.9% of the statutory
lending limit. The Executive Directors have issued guidelines pursuant to which all guarantees issued by IBRD are included
in the calculation of this ratio from the time those guarantees first become callable.
In 1991 the Executive Directors decided that discussions on an additional capital increase would be initiated if IBRD's
lending commitments during any fiscal year reach 80% of the sustainable level of lending (the level that in IBRD's judgment
could be sustained without the need for additional capital). IBRD's lending commitments for FY 1998 were $21,086 million,
or 77.7% of the sustainable level of lending. In May 1998 IBRD reviewed the lending program and concluded that the risk of
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 193



breaching the statutory lending limit was low and that discussions on additional capital increases for the purpose of
commitment authority were not currently warranted.
Other Activities
In addition to its financial operations, IBRD has furnished technical assistance to its member countries, both in connection
with and independently of loan operations. Such assistance has taken a variety of forms, including the assignment of qualified
professionals to survey development possibilities of member countries, to analyze their fiscal, economic and other
development problems, to assist member countries in drawing up development programs, to appraise projects suitable for
investment and to assist member countries in improving their asset and liability management techniques. To assist its
developing member countries, IBRD also established an Economic Development Institute, which provides courses and other
training activities dealing with economic policy, development and administration for selected groups of government officials,
and has made contributions for research and other developmental activities. Furthermore, IBRD has on a number of occasions
at the request of members concerned, facilitated efforts toward the settlement of international economic and financial
disputes. Additionally, IBRD, alone or jointly with IDA, administers on behalf of donors, funds restricted for specific uses.
These funds are held in trust and are not included in the assets of IBRD. See the Notes to Financial Statements-Note H.
3. Risk Management
IBRD assumes various kinds of risks in the process of providing development banking services. Its activities can give rise to
three major types of risk: credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk. IBRD is also exposed to operating risk. These risks are
described below.
The objective of Asset-Liability Management (ALM) at IBRD is to ensure adequate funding for each product at the most
attractive available cost, and to manage the currency composition, maturity profile and interest rate sensitivity characteristics
of the portfolio of liabilities supporting each product in accordance with the particular requirements for that product and
within prescribed risk parameters.
The major risk inherent to IBRD is (country) credit risk, or loan portfolio risk. IBRD is also subject to commercial credit,
market (interest and exchange rate), operating and liquidity risk, which it actively manages. The risk management governance
structure begins with the Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) which makes decisions or recommendations to
senior management in the areas of financial policy, the adequacy and allocation of risk capital, and oversight of financial
reporting. There are three standing subcommittees reporting to ALCO:
The Market Risk and Currency Management Subcommittee develops and monitors the policies under which market and
commercial credit risks faced by IBRD are measured, reported and managed. The subcommittee also monitors compliance
with policies governing commercial credit exposure and currency management. Specific areas of activity include establishing
guidelines for limiting balance sheet and market risks and the use of derivative instruments, and monitoring of matches
between assets and their funding.
The role of the Financial Policy and Information Technology Subcommittee is to identify, discuss and resolve issues in
financial policies and information technology initiatives under development in IBRD's financial complex.
The role of the Strategc Credit Subcommittee is to monitor global economic and political trends for their effect on
individual country risks, portfolio concentration characteristics, trends in exposures to risk clusters, and aggregate changes in
the magnitude, nature and composition of credit risk in the portfolio. Strategic issues such as the credit risk implications of
new IBRD lending products, the allocation of capital, loan loss provisioning, arrears clearance and debt repayment workouts
form a significant portion of this subcommittee's agenda.
For the day-to-day management of risk, IBRD's risk management structure extends into its business units. Risk management
processes have been established to facilitate, control, and monitor risk-taking. These processes are built on a foundation of
initial identification and measurement of risks by each of the business units.
The processes and procedures by which IBRD manages its risk profile continually evolve as its activities change in response
to market, credit, product, and other developments. The Executive Directors periodically review trends in IBRD's risk
profiles and performance as well as any significant developments in risk management policies and controls.

Credit Risk
Credit risk, the risk of loss from default by a borrower or counterparty, is inherent in IBRD's business. Under the direction of
the ALCO, policies and procedures for measuring and managing such risks are formulated, approved and communicated
throughout IBRD. Senior managers represented on ALCO are responsible for maintaining sound credit assessments,
addressing transaction and product risk issues, providing an independent review function and monitoring the loans,
investments and borrowings portfolios.
IBRD faces two main types of credit risk: country credit risk and commercial credit risk.
Counfry Credit Risk
Country credit risk is the primary risk faced by IBRD. It has three components. Expected losses from all three components are
covered by the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses, while unexpected losses are covered by IBRD's risk-bearing capital
and income generating capacity. IBRD continuously reviews the creditworthiness of its member countries as borrowers and
adjusts its overall country programs and lending operations to reflect the results of these reviews.
(i) The first component is idiosyncratic risk or the risk that individual countries will accumulate extended debt-
service arrears (or move closer to accumulating extended payment arrears) for country specific reasons.
(ii) The second component is covariance risk. This is the risk that one or more borrowers will accumulate extended
payment arrears (or move closer to accumulating extended payment arrears) as a result of a common shock.
This shock could be, for example, a regional political crisis or an adverse change in the global environment
(such as a fall in commodity prices or a rise in international interest rates).
(iii) The third component is portfolio concentration risk. This reflects the concentration in IBRD's portfolio that
results from lending to a relatively small group of borrowers. This concentration exacerbates the idiosyncratic
and covariance risk described above. This risk is managed using the portfolio concentration limit described
below.
In 1997 the Executive Directors approved an approach to portfolio concentration under which IBRD's largest
loan portfolio exposure to a single borrowing country is restricted to the lower of an equitable access limit or a
concentration risk limit. The equitable access limit is equal to 10% of IBRD's subscribed capital, reserves and
unallocated surplus. The concentration risk limit is based on the adequacy of IBRD's equity capital relative to its
largest loan portfolio exposure to a single borrowing country. The concentration risk limit takes into account not
only current exposure, but also projected exposure over the ensuing three- to five-year period. This limit is
determined by the Executive Directors each year at the time they consider IBRD's reserves adequacy and the
allocation of its net income for the preceding fiscal year. For FY 1998 the concentration risk limit was set at
$13.5 billion. The equitable access limit was $20.2 billion. IBRD's largest loan portfolio exposure (including
the present value of guarantees) to a single borrowing country was $11.4 billion at June 30, 1998.
Overdue and Non-performing Loans
It is IBRD's policy that if a payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to an IBRD loan or IDA credit
becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any other borrower in that country, will be presented to
the Executive Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until payment for all amounts 30 days
overdue or longer has been received. In addition, if such payments become 60 days overdue, disbursements on all loans to or
guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid. Where the member country is
not the borrower, the time period for suspension of the approval and signing of new loans to or guaranteed by the member
country is 45 days and the time period for suspension of disbursements is 60 days. It is the policy of IBRD to place all loans
made to or guaranteed by a member of IBRD in nonaccrual status, if principal, interest or other charges on any such loan are
overdue by more than six months, unless IBRD's management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the
immediate future. IBRD maintains an Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses to recognize the risk inherent in current and
potential overdue payments. The methodology for determining the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses is discussed in
detail below. Additional information on IBRD's provisioning policy and status of nonaccrual loans can be found in the
Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies and Note C of the Financial Statements.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 195



In 1991 the Executive Directors adopted a policy to assist members with protracted arrears to IBRD to mobilize sufficient
resources to clear their arrears and to support a sustainable growth-oriented adjustment program over the medium term.
Under this policy rBRD will develop a lending strategy and will process loans, but not sign or disburse such loans, during a
pre-clearance performance period with respect to members that: (a) agree to and implement a medium-term, growth-oriented
structural adjustment program endorsed by IBRD; (b) undertake a stabilization program, if necessary, endorsed, or financially
supported, by the IMF; (c) agree to a financing plan to clear all arrears to EBRD and other multilateral creditors in the context
of a medium-term structural adjustment program; and (d) make debt-service payments as they fall due on IBRD loans during
the performance period. The signing, effectiveness and disbursement of such loans will not take place until the member's
arrears to IBRD have been fully cleared.
Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses
IBRD's Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses reflects the following:
* Management's assessment of the overall collectibility risk in the total accruing loan portfolio (which includes
callable guarantees); and
* The present value losses on nonaccruing loans. Such losses are equal to the difference between the discounted
present value of the debt-service payments on a loan at its contractual terms and the expected cash flows on
that loan.
The adequacy of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses is determined by assessing the amount required to cover
potential expected losses in the accrual portfolio and losses inherent in the nonaccrual portfolio. The amount required to
cover potential expected losses in the accruing portfolio is related to mean of the distribution of losses facing the institution
over the next three years. This is calculated using a risk-adjusted capital allocation framework that takes into account the
concentration and covariance risk in the portfolio. The amount required to cover losses inherent in the nonaccrual portfolio is
based on the calculation of the discounted present value of cash flows.
Estimating potential losses is inherently uncertain and depends on many factors, including general macroeconomic and
political conditions, unexpected correlations within the portfolio, and other external factors. IBRD periodically reviews such
factors and reassesses the adequacy of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses accordingly.
Commercial Credit Risk
IBRD's commercial credit risk is concentrated in instruments issued by sovereigns, agencies, banks and corporate entities.
The majority of these investments are with AAA and AA institutions.
In the normal course of its business, IBRD utilizes various derivatives and foreign exchange financial instruments to meet the
financial needs of its borrowers, to generate income through its trading activities, and to manage its exposure to fluctuations in
interest and currency rates.
Derivative and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varying degrees, credit risk. The effective management of credit risk
is vital to the success of IBRD's trading and ALM activities. Because of changing market environment, the monitoring and
managing of these risks is a continual process.
IBRD seeks to control the credit risk arising from derivatives and foreign exchange transactions through its credit approval
process, the use of collateral agreements and risk control limits, and monitoring procedures. The credit approval process
involves evaluating each counterparty's creditworthiness, assigning credit limits to each counterparty, and determining if there
are specific transaction characteristics that alter the risk profile. Credit limits are calculated and monitored on the basis of
potential exposures taking into consideration current market values and estimates of potential future movements in those
values. If there is a collateral agreement with the counterparty to reduce credit risk, then the amount and nature of the
collateral obtained is based on the credit rating of the counterparty. Collateral held includes cash and government securities.
IBRD's management treats the credit risk exposure as the replacement cost of the derivative or foreign exchange product.
This is also referred to as replacement risk or the mark-to-market exposure amount. While notional principal is the most
commonly used volume mneasure in the derivative and foreign exchange markets, it is not a measure of credit or market risk.
196 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 1998



Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open
market. When the mark-to-market is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes IBRD and, therefore, creates a replacement
risk for EB RD. When the mark-to-market is negative, IBRD owes the counterparty and does not have replacement risk.
When IBRD has more than one transaction outstanding with a counterparty, and there exists a legally-enforceable master
agreement with the counterparty, the "net" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative
exposures with the same counterparty. If this net mark-to-market is negative, then IBRD's exposure to the counterparty is
considered to be zero. Net mark-to-market is, in IBRD's view, the best measure of credit risk when there is a legally-
enforceable master netting agreement between IBRD and the counterparty. For the notional amounts and related credit risk
exposure amounts by product, see the Notes to Financial Statements-Note E.
The following table provides details of IBRD's estimated credit exposure-by counterparty rating category-on its
investments and swaps, net of collateral held:

The increase in credit exposure during the year reflects the increase in the size of the investment portfolio. The credit
exposure from swaps declined from FY 1997 to FY 1998 by $38 million to $617 million. The increase in the relative weight
of credit exposures to AAA-rated entities was mainly due to the addition of asset swaps and asset-backed securities to the
investment instruments used.
Interest Rate Risk
There are two potential sources of interest rate risk to IBRD. The first is the interest rate sensitivity associated with the net
spread between the rate IBRD earns on its assets and the cost of borrowings which fund those assets. The second is the
interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a portion of IBRD assets with equity. The borrowing cost pass-
through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on most of IBRD's loans has traditionally helped limit the
interest rate sensitivity of the net spread earnings on its loan portfolio. Such cost pass-through loans currently account for
more than 87% of the existing outstanding loan portfolio. However, cost pass-through loans do entail some residual interest
rate risk, given the one-semester lag inherent in the lending rate formulation. If new borrowings are at interest rates above the
average in the debt pool, the higher average debt costs would not be passed through to the lending rate charged to the
borrowers and thus not affect the interest income generated on cost pass-through loans until the following semester. The
reverse is trae when market interest rates decline.
In addition, the cost pass-through currency pool products have traditionally been funded with a large share of medium- and
long-term fixed rate borrowings, so as to provide the borrowers with a reasonably stable interest basis. Given the sustained
interest rate declines seen over the last several years, the cost of these historical fixed rate borrowings in the multicurrency
pool and the single currency pools is currently considerably higher than IBRD's new borrowing costs. In particular,
approximately $327 million of this historical (and currently 'above-market') debt allocated to the multicurrency pool has
contractual imaturities longer than that of the longest outstanding loans. In the absence of new disbursements and additions to
the multicurTency pool, IBRD would be subject to some risk associated with potentially having to redeploy these above-
market borrowings, as and when the loans mature.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 197



Interest rate risk on non cost pass-through products, which currently account for 13% of the existing portfolio, is controlled by
using interest rate swaps to closely align the rate sensitivity characteristics of the loan portfolio with that of their underlying
funding. The interest rate risk on IBRD's liquid portfolio is managed within specified duration-mismatch limits and is further
limited by stop-loss limits. As a result of changes in policy, liquidity has been funded by floating rate debt since June 1996.
This has enabled the match-funding of liquidity with associated debt sharing the same interest rate characteristics as the liquid
portfolio to take place.
IBRD's level of net income is sensitive to the level of nominal interest rates, reflecting the fact that these rates determine the
level of earnings on its equity base ($23,300 million at June 30, 1998) that funds a portion of the outstanding loans (net of
provisions). In general, lower nominal interest rates result in lower lending rates which, in turn, reduce the nominal earnings
on IBRD's equity.
Interest rate risk also arises from a variety of other factors, including differences in the timing between the contractual
maturity or repricing of IBRD's assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments. For example, IBRD's net interest
income and financial condition are affected by changes in the level of market interest rates as the repricing characteristics of
its loans and other assets do not necessarily match those of its borrowings. With regard to floating rate assets and liabilities,
IBRD is exposed to timing mismatches between the reset dates on its floating rate receivables and payables.
As part of its ALM process IBRD employs interest rate swaps to manage and align the rate sensitivity characteristics of its
assets and liabilities. IBRD uses derivative instruments to adjust the interest rate repricing characteristics of specific on-
balance sheet assets and liabilities, or groups of assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics.
Exchange Rate Risk
In order to minimize exchange rate risk in a multicurrency environment, IBRD matches its borrowing obligations in any one
currency (after swap activities) with assets in the same currency, as prescribed by the Articles, primarily by holding or lending
the proceeds of its borrowings in the same currencies in which they were borrowed. In addition, IBRD's policy is to
minimize the exchange rate sensitivity of its reserves-to-loans ratio. It carries out this policy by undertaking currency
conversions periodically to align the currency composition of its reserves to that of its outstanding loans. This policy is
designed to minimize the impact of market rate fluctuations on the reserves to loans ratio, thereby preserving IBRD's ability
to absorb potential losses from arrears regardless of the market environment.

Operating Risk
Operating risk is the potential for loss arising from internal activities or external events caused by breakdowns in information,
communication, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, settlement systems and
procedures, and the execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. IBRD, like all financial institutions, is exposed
to many types of operating risks, including the risk of fraud by staff or outsiders. IBRD attempts to mitigate operating risk by
maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls that is designed to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in view
of the financial strength of IBRD and the characteristics of the activities and markets in which IBRD operates. In the past
IBRD has suffered certain immaterial losses from operating risk and while it maintains an adequate system of internal
controls, there can be no absolute assurance that IBRD will not suffer such losses in the future.
IBRD adopted the COSOI control framework and a self-assessment methodolgy to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal
controls in FY 1996, and has an on-going program in place to cover all business units. Commencing in FY 1997, IBRD
obtained an attestation from its external auditors on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.
Economic and Monetary Union in Europe (EMU)
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty on European Union set the framework for forming an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
with a single currency, the euro, and a single monetary policy defined by a common independent authority, the European
Central Bank. EMU creates various operating risks for IBRD because significant changes will have to be implemented
including currency conversion, modification of payment and settlement systems, redenomination of currencies, and financial
reporting changes. The main challenge posed by EMU is the extended transition period (three years) when payments can be
made in each participating member state in euro and in the previous national currency which remains a sub-denomination of
the euro during the transition. IBRD has created an internal euro task force which is working in conjunction with various
I The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (commonly referred to as COSO) was convened
by the U.S Congress in response to the well publicized financial irregularities that occurred in the late 1980's.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 199



business unit groups to identify and address the changes required by the introduction of the euro. Management expects that a
plan will be adopted and changes will be implemented on a schedule which meets the EMU start date of January 1, 1999.
The Year 2000 Issue
The Year 2000 (Y2K) issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year.
Some of IBRD's computer programs that have date-sensitive software may be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the
year 1999. This could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other
things, a temporary inability to process transactions. IBRD presently believes that timely modifications to existing software
and or hardware will mitigate its Y2K risks.
Over the last five years, IBRD has revamped many of its systems, in the process making them Y2K compliant. Also, IBRD is
currently replacing many of its individual systems with either an SAP or a Summit solution at a cost of approximately $45
million. Both these systems are Y2K compliant. This implementation is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999. The
date on which IBRD plans to complete the Y2K modifications is based on management's best estdmates, which were derived
utilizing numerous assumptions of future events. However, there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and
actual results could differ materially from those plans. Specific factors that might cause such material differences include, but
are not limited to, the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area, the ability to locate and correct all relevant
computer codes and similar uncertainties.
4. Liquidity Management
Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of IBRD's activities and in the management of positions. It includes the risk of
being unable to fund its portfolio of assets at appropriate maturities and rates and the risk of being unable to liquidate a
position in a timely manner at a reasonable price. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of
sufficient cash flows to meet all of IBRD's financial commitments.
Under IBRD's liquidity management policy aggregate liquid asset holdings should be kept at or above a specified prudential
minimum. That minimum is equal to the highest six months of debt-service plus one-half of net loan disbursements as
projected for a fiscal year based on commitments at the beginning of that year. IBRD also holds liquid assets over the
specified minimum to provide flexibility in timing its borrowing transactions and to meet working capital needs.
IBRD's liquid holdings are held principally in obligations of governments and other official entities, time deposits and other
unconditional obligationis of banks and financial institutions, asset-backed securities, and futures and options contracts
pertaining to such obligations. The liquid asset holdings are separated into three sub-portfolios, each with different risk
profiles, funding, and liquidity characteristics, but all contributing to the prudential purpose of liquidity. The three sub-
portfolios are summarized below:
Stable Portfolio
The "stable" portfolio is the equivalent of the prudential minimum. In line with its purpose as a cash cushion in times of
financial stress, the portfolio is held in an adequately liquid form to reasonably assure IBRD of the fund's availability to meet
commitments over a six-month period. The portfolio size is relatively constant, allowing for consideration of a wide range of
management strategies, imcluding taking duration and credit risk.
The FY 1999 prudential minimum liquidity level has been set at $18,500 million, representing a $1,200 million increase over
that forFY 1998.
Operational Portfolio
The "operational" portfolio is the equivalent of IBRD's operating cash account and meets IBRD's short-term cash
requirements, i.e., working capital needs, by ensuring that funds are available as needed to meet payment obligations.
Balances in this portfolio require a high degree of liquidity and only minimal credit or market risk is taken. The aggregate size
of this portfolio is also influenced to an extent by this need, at times, to have balances in multiple currencies, especially those
in which IBRD does not have a ready source of short-term funding.
200 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 1998



Discretionary Portfolio
The "discretionary" portfolio is the locus of flexibility for IBRD's funding program and is governed by a comparison of the
various costs and benefits of incremental borrowing and investment decisions. The size of the discretionary portfolio depends
upon the perceived usefulness of borrowing in advance of immediate needs, on the relative attractiveness of market
opportunities and on the usefulness of additional short-term borrowings for market presence purposes.
IBRD's cash and liquid investments amounted to $24,648 million (including $1,299 million classified as held-to-maturity
investments) at June 30, 1998. This amount was equivalent to approximately 23.3% of IBRD's outstanding borrowings after
swaps. The annualized financial return on average investments in IEBRD's trading portfolio for FY 1998 was 5.459%
compared to 4.73% in FY 1997. Ihe return on its held-to-maturity portfolio for FY 1998 was 8.44% compared to 8.31% for
FY 1997.
For further information, refer to the Notes to Financial Statements-Note B.
5. Funding Resources
Equity
Total shareholders' equity at June 30, 1998 was $26,514 million compared with $27,228 million at June 30, 1997. The slight
decrease from FY 1997 primarily reflects the revaluation effects of exchange rate movements of $1,045 million which offset
the increase in retained earnings of $539 million and the increase in paid-in capital of $240 million. At June 30, 1998, this
equity comprised $11,288 million of paid-in capital and $16,733 million of retained earnings, reduced by $547 million of
amounts to maintain value of currency holdings and payments on account of pending subscriptions, and $960 million of
cumulative translation adjustment.
Capital
The authorized capital of IBRD at June 30, 1998 was $190,811 million, of which $186,436 million had been subscribed. Of
the subscribed capital, $11,288 million had been paid in and $175,148 million was callable. Of the paid-in capital, $7,677
million was available for lending and $3,611 million was not available for lending. The terms of payment of IBRD's capital
and the restrictions on its use that are derived from the Articles and from resolutions of IBRD's Board of Governors are:
(i) $2,370 million of IBRD's capital was initially paid in gold or U.S. dollars or was converted by the subscribing
members into U.S. dollars. This amount may, under the Articles, be freely used by IBRD in its operations.
(ii) $8,918 million of IBRD's capital was paid in the currencies of the subscribing members. Under the Articles this
amount is subject to maintenance-of-value obligations and may be loaned only with the consent of the member
whose currency is involved. In accordance with such consents, $5,096 million of this amount had been used in
IBRD's lending operations at June 30, 1998.
(iii) $149,149 million of IBRD's capital may, under the Articles, be called only when required to meet obligations of
IBRD for funds borrowed or on loans guaranteed by it. This amount is thus not available for use by IBRD in
making loans. Payment on any such call may be made, at the option of the particular member, either in gold, in
U.S. dollars or in the currency required to discharge the obligations of IBRD for which the call is made.
(iv) $25,999 million of IBRD's capital is to be called only when required to meet obligations of IBRD for funds
borrowed or on loans guaranteed by it, pursuant to resolution of the Board of Governors of IBRD (though such
conditions are not required by the Articles). Of this amount, 10% would be payable in gold or U.S. dollars and
90% in the currencies of the subscribing members. While these resolutions are not legally binding on future
Boards of Governors, they do record an understanding among members that this amount will not be called for
use by IBRD in its lending activities or for administrative purposes.
No call has ever been made on IBRD's callable capital. Any calls on unpaid subscriptions are required to be uniform, but the
obligations of the members of IBRD to make payment on such calls are independent of each other. If the arnount received on
a call is insufficient to meet the obligations of IBRD for which the call is made, EBRD has the right and is bound to make
further calls until the amounts received are sufficient to meet such obligations. However, no member may be required on any
such call or calls to pay more than the unpaid balance of its capital subscription.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 201



At June 30, 1998, of the uncalled capital, $102,563 million (58.6%) was callable from the member countries of IBRD that are
also members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
This amount was equal to 97.1% of IBRD's outstanding borrowings after swaps at June 30, 1998. The capital subscriptions of
those countries and the callable amounts are set out below:

Borrowings
IBRD diversifies its sources of funding by offering its securities to private and official investors globally on terms acceptable
to IBRD. Official investors are governments, central banks and other governmental institutions. Under the Articles, IBRD
may borrow only with the approval of the member in whose markets the funds are raised and the member in whose currency
the borrowing is denomninated, and only if each such member agrees that the proceeds may be exchanged for the currency of
any other member without restriction.
In FY 1998 medium- and long-term debt raised from the market by IBRD amounted to $28,020 million. This excludes
proceeds from continuous short-term issuance programs, i.e., Central Bank Facility and Discount Notes, and transactions with
a maturity of less than one year. The increase in medium- and long-term borrowings in FY 1998 primarily reflected increased
loan disbursements in response to the financial crisis in East Asia and adjustment lending in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Most new funding was swapped initially into floating rates. Fixed rates were established subsequently for some of this
funding in accordance with the requirements of different loan products and policy guidelines.
The after-swap currency composition of new funding was mostly in U.S. dollars and reflected the need to fund loan assets and
liquidity. Borrowings were carried out in those currencies that provided the best market opportunities, resulting in 195
transactions during FY 1998.
IBRD buys its debt back strategically to reduce the cost of borrowings and to reduce exposure to refunding requirements in a
particular year. During FY 1998 IBRD repurchased a total of $540 million of its outstanding borrowings and prepaid $561
million of its outstanding borrowings.
A more detailed analysis of borrowings is provided in the Notes to Financial Statements-Note D.
6. Results Of Operations
IBRD's net income can be seen as broadly comprising a spread on earming assets, plus the contribution of equity, less
provisions for loan losses and administrative expenses. The significant factors affecting the spread on earning assets are
described below:
o   Loans are funded by a combination of debt and equity, with debt funding approximately 77% of loans.
Most loans are subject to a cost pass-through formulation with the loans carrying a variable lending rate linked
to the particular borrowings allocated to them. Such cost pass-through loans currently account for
approximately 87% of the outstanding loan portfolio. Other loans which are not cost pass-through products,
comprise 13% of the existing loan portfolio.
Income generated from loans funded by equity is directly sensitive to the level of nominal interest rates with
any changes in these rates directly impacting net income. Loans funded by equity comprise 23% of the loan
portfolio.
+ Investments are primarily funded by variable rate debt sharing the same interest rate characteristics as the
investment portfolio. As a result the interest rate sensitivity of the spread of investment returns over its cost of
funding has been substantially eliminated with net investment income being largely unaffected by interest rate
fluctuations. Further, the impact on net income from the margin on the investment portfolio is not significant.

Net income as a percentage of average earning assets declined 6 basis points from 1.04% for FY 1997 to 0.98% for FY 1998.
The following main factors contributed to the decline: increased loan loss provisioning, the negative effect of the conversions
of multicurrency pool loans to single currency pool terms and lower nominal rates for loans funded by equity. These negative
effects on net income were partially offset by gains attributed to IBRD's pension and other postretirement benefit accounts.
The negative effect of the conversions of the multicurrency pool loans to single currency pool (SCP) terms was the primary
factor lowering the net interest income margin on average earning assets. The SCP conversions reduced the loan spread

through the interaction of the change in currency composition, resulting in a higher nominal rate, with the lag in the pass-
through lending rate. Effectively, this raised debt costs before raising the lending rate on the affected loans.

The decrease in loan income of $542 million (7.6%o) was primarily due to a falling interest rate environment in the major
financial markets and the continuing maturity of high-interest, fixed rate loans. Of the decrease in loan interest income, $290
million was due to a decrease in the average interest rate of the loan portfolio, and $136 million was associated with the
decrease in the balance of average loans outstanding in terms of U.S. dollars. The other major factor contributing to the
change in loan income was the increase in the provision for loan losses. During FY 1998 the expected losses due to the
changes in the credit quality of the portfolio combined with growth in net disbursements resulted in an increase in the
provision for loan losses of $188 million from FY 1997 to PY 1998.

During FY 1998 investment income increased by $399 million (47.7%). Of this increase, $103 million resulted from higher
returns (up from 5.0% to 5.6%) mainly due to a shift from Japanese yen and Deutsche mark investments into higher-yield
U.S. dollar investments. Higher average outstanding investment balances, reflecting the modified liquidity policy, accounted
for the remaining increase of $296 million.
MANAGEMENT'S DIsCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 205



The cost of borrowings increased by $192 million (3.2%). The replacement of longer maturity fixed rate debt with variable
rate debt, coupled with a falling interest rate environment, lowered the average cost of borrowings from 6.14% to 6.10%. This
decrease was offset by a higher average borrowings balance, resulting in an increase of $231 million in borrowing costs.
FY 1997 versus FY 1996
Net interest income totaled $2,054 million in FY 1997, compared to $2,030 million in FY 1996. The reduction in total
interest income of $594 million in FY 1997 as compared to FY 1996 was offset by a slightly larger decrease in the cost of
borrowings of $618 million, resulting in a $24 million increase in net interest income.
The reduction in loan interest income arose from lower average loan interest rates driven by a decline in the average cost of
borrowings, resulting from a declining interest rate environment in the financial markets. A 21 basis point decline in the
average loan interest rate resulted in a reduction of $240 million, while a decrease of $7,283 million in the average
outstanding loans balance accounted for a $517 million reduction in gross interest income. The negative effect of non-
performing loan interest in FY 1997 was lower by $42 million primarily due to the clearance of arrears of loan interest and
charges by Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 1996, and its subsequent debt-service payments during FY 1997.
Investment income increased by $114 million mainly due to a shift from Japanese yen and Deutsche mark investments into
higher-yield U.S. dollar investments.

Net noninterest expenses declined by $293 million. This decrease is attributable to the recognition of additional income from
pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
1997 versus 1996
Net noninterest expenses declined by $74 million in FY 1997. In FY 1997 income resulting from a change in assumptions
associated with the Staff Retirement Plan of $112 million reduced total net noninterest expense.

Purpose Sand Affiliated Organizations
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international organization which commenced oper-
ations in 1946. The principal purpose of IBRD is to promote economic development in its member countries, primarily by pro-
viding loans and related technical assistance for specific projects and for programs of economic reform in developing member
countries. The activities of IBRD are complemented by those of three affiliated organizations, the International Development
Association JIDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent from IBRD. with separate assets and liabilities, and IBRD is
not liable for their respective obligations. IDA's purpose is to promote economic development in the less developed areas of the
world included in IDA's membership by providing financing on concessionary teims. IFC's puipose is to encourage the growth
of productive private enterprises in its member countries through loans and equity investments in such enterprises without a
member's guarantee. MIGA was established to encourage the flow of investments for productive purposes among member
countries and, in particular, to developing member countries by providing guarantees against noncommercial risks for foreign
investment iin its developing member countries.
Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies
IBRD's financial statements are prepared in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and with International Accounting Standards.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments have been used in the computation of estimated
and fair values of loans and borrowings, the determination of the adequacy of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses, the
determination of net periodic pension cost and the present value of obligations.
Certain reclassifications of the prior years' information have been made to conform to the current year's presentation.
Translation of Currencies: IBRD's financial statements are expressed in terms of U.S. dollars solely for the purpose of
summarizing IBRD's financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its members and other interested
parties.
IBRD is an international organization which conducts its operations in the currencies of all of its members. IBRD's resources
are derived from its capital, borrowings, and accumulated earnings in those various currencies. IBRD has a number of general
policies aimed at minimizing exchange rate risk in a multicurrency environment. IBRD matches its borrowing obligations in
any one currency (after swaps) with assets in the same currency, as prescribed by its Articles of Agreement, primarily by
holding or ]ending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swaps) in the same currencies in which they are borrowed. In addition.
IBRD periodically undertakes currency conversions to more closely match the currencies underlying its Retained Earnings
with those of the outstanding loans.
Assets and liabilities are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Income and expenses are
translated at either the market exchange rates in effect on the dates on which they are recognized or at an average of the market
exchange rates in effect during each month. Translation adjustments are charged or credited to Equity.
Valuation of Capital Stock: In the Articles of Agreement, the capital stock of IBRD is expressed in terms of "U.S. dollars of
the weight and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944" (1944 dollars). Following the abolition of gold as a common denominator of
the monetary system and the repeal of the provision of the U.S. law defining the par value of the U.S. dollar in terms of gold,
the pre-existing basis for translating 1944 dollars into current dollars or into any other currency disappeared. The Executive
IBRD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 221



Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
Directors of IBRD have decided, until such time as the relevant provisions of the Articles of Agreement are amended, that the
words "U.S. dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944" in Article II, Section 2(a) of the Articles of
Agreement of IBRD are interpreted to mean the Special Drawing Right (SDR) introduced by the International Monetary Fund.
as the SDR was valued in terms of U.S. dollars immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR
on July 1, 1974. such value being $1.20635 for one SDR.
Maintenanice of Value: Akrticle II, Section 9 of the Articles of Agreement provides for maintenance of the value (MOV), at the
time of subscription, of such restricted currencies (see Note A), requiring (1) the member to make additional payments to
IBRD in the event that the par value of its currency is reduced or the foreign exchange value of its currency has, in the opinion
of IBRD, depreciated to a significant extent in its territories and (2) IBRD to reimburse the member in the event that the par
value of its currency is increased.
Since currencies no longe r have par values, maintenance of value amounts are determined by measuring the foreign exchange
value of a member's currency against the standard of value of IBRD capital based on the 1974 SDR. Members are required to
make payments to IBRD if their currencies depreciate significantly relative to the standard of value. Furthermore, the
Executive Directors have adopted a policy of reimbursing members whose currencies appreciate significantly in terms of the
standard of value.
The net MOV amounts relating to restricted currencies out on loan, and amounts that have been reclassified from receivables
for those countries that have been in arrears for two years or more, are included in Amounts to Maintain Value of Currency
Holdings. For amounts on loan, these MOV amounts are shown as a component of Equity since MOV becomes effective only
as such currencies are repaid to IBRD.
Retainied Earniings: Retained Earnings consists of allocated amounts (Special Reserve, General Reserve, Pension Reserve and
Surplus) and unallocated Net Income.
The Special Reserve consists of loan commissions set aside pursuant to Article IV, Section 6 of the Articles of Agreement,
which are to be held in liquid assets. These assets may be used only for the purpose of meeting liabilities of IBRD on its
borrowings and guarantees in the event of defaults on loans made, participated in, or guaranteed by IBRD. The Special
Reserve assets are included under Investments held in the Trading portfolio, comprising obligations of the United States
Government. its agencies, and other official entities. The allocation of such commissions to the Special Reserve was
discontinued in 1964 with respect to subsequent loans and no further additions are being made to it.
The General Reserve consists of eamings from prior fiscal years which, in the judgment of the Executive Directors, should be
retained in IBRD's operations.
The Pension Reserve consists of the difference between actual funding of the Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) and the Plan's
accounting income for the fiscal year 1997. This Pension Reserve would be reduced if in any future fiscal year pension
accounting expenses were to exceed the actual funding of the Plan.
Surplus consists of earnings from prior fiscal years which are retained by IBRD until a further decision is made on their
disposition or the conditions of transfer for specified uses have been met.
Unallocated Net Income consists of earnings in the current fiscal year. Commencing in 1950, a portion or all of the unallocated
Net Income has been allocated to the General Reserve. The Board of Governors, consisting of one Governor appointed by each
member, periodically approves transfers out of unallocated Net Income and Surplus, components of Retained Earnings, after
an assessment by the Executive Directors of IBRD's reserve needs, to various entities for development purposes consistent
with IBRD's Articles of Agreement.

Notes to Financial Statements
Loans: All of IBRD's loans are made to or guaranteed by members, except loans to IFC. The majority of IBRD's loans have
repayment obligations in various currencies determined on the basis of a currency pooling system. IBRD also offers single
currency loans. Except for certain loans which were converted to the currency pooling system, loans negotiated prior to July
1980 and all single currency loans are repayable in the currencies disbursed.
Any loan origination fees incorporated in a loan's terms are deferred and recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment
of yield. However, incremental direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred as such amounts are
considered immaterial.
It is IBRD's practice not to reschedule interest or principal payments on its loans or participate in debt rescheduling agree-
ments with respect to its loans. In exceptional cases, however, such as when implementation of a financed project has been
delayed, the loan amortization schedule may be modified to avoid substantial repayments prior to project completion. Delays
in receiving loan payments result in present value losses to IBRD since it does not charge fees or additional interest on any
overdue interest or loan charges. These present value losses are equal to the difference between the present value of payments
for interest and charges made according to the related loan's contractual terms and the present value of its expected future cash
flows. Such present value losses are considered in the determination of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses. IBRD has
not written off any of its outstanding loans.
It is the policy of IBRD to place in nonaccrual status all loans made to or guaranteed by a member of IBRD if principal, inter-
est, or other charges with respect to any such loan are overdue by more than six months, unless IBRD management determines
that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. In addition, if development credits made by IDA to a mem-
ber government are placed in nonaccrual status, all loans made to or guaranteed by that member government will also be
placed in noriaccrual status by IBRD. On the date a member's loans are placed in nonaccrual status, unpaid interest and other
charges accried on loans outstanding to the member are deducted from the income of the curTent period. Interest and other
charges on nonaccruing loans are included in income only to the extent that payments have actually been received by IBRD. If
collectibility risk is considered to be particularly high at the time of arrears clearance, the member's loans may not automati-
cally emerge from nonaccrual status, even though the member's eligibility for new loans may have been restored. A decision
on the restoration of accrual status is made on a case-by-case basis after a suitable period of payment performance has passed
from the time of arrears clearance.
IBRD determines the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses based on an assessment of collectibility risk in the total loan and
callable guarantees portfolio, including loans in nonaccrual status. The accumulated provision is periodically adjusted based
on a review of the prevailing circumstances. Adjustments to the accumulated provision are recorded as a charge or credit to
income. In the context of determining the adequacy of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses, IBRD considers the
present value of expected cash flows relative to the contractual cash flows for loans.
Investments: Investment securities are classified based on IBRD management's intention on the date of purchase. Securities
which management has the intention and ability to hold until maturity are included in the Held-to-maturity portfolio and
reported at amortized cost. Securities designated for other postretirement benefits are carried and reported at market value or at
their estimated fair values. The changes in the values of the securities designated for other postretirement benefits are included
in the deterrnination of net income. All other investment securities are held in a Trading portfolio and classified as an element
of liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows due to their nature and IBRD's policies governing the level and use of such
investments. Investment securities and related financial instruments held in IBRD's Trading portfolio are carried and reported
at market value. Unrealized gains and losses for financial instruments held in the Trading portfolio are included in income.
Derivative instruments are used in liquidity management to take advantage of profitable trading opportunities and as a proxy
for cash securities. These instruments include short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps, cross-
currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, and exchange-traded futures and options on fixed income instruments. These
IBRD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 223



Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
derivatives are carried at market value, From time to time, IBRD eniters into forward contracts for the sale or purchase of
investment securities: these transactions are recorded at the time of commitment.
Securities Purchased U7nder Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Unider Repurchase Agreements: Securities purchased
under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are recorded at historical cost. IBRD takes posses-
sion of securities purchased under resale agreements. monitors the fair value of the securities and, if necessary. requires addi-
tional collateral.
Borrowings: To ensure funds are available for lending and liquidity purposes. IBRD borrows in the worldwide capital markets
offering its securities to private and governmental buyers. IBRD issues short-term  and medium- and long-term  debt
instruments denominated in various currencies with both fixed and adjustable interest rates. Borrowings are carried on the
balance sheet at their par value (face value') adjusted for any unamortized premiums or discounts. Issuance costs associated
with a bond offering are deferred and amortized over the period during which the related indebtedness is outstanding. The
unamortized balance of the issuance costs is included in Other Assets on the balance sheet, and the issuance costs amortization
is presented as a separate element under Borrowing Expenses on the income statement. Amortization of discounts and
premiums is included in interest under Borrowing Expenses on the income statement.
IBRD uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to create synthetic debt instruments to take
advantage of cost saving opportunities across capital markets and lower its funding costs, to delink the time at which its
borrowing costs are fixed from the timing of the actual market borrowings, and to establish an appropriate match between the
currency and interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities. These instruments include currency and interest rate
swaps, swap spread-locks, foreign exchange forwards, exchange-traded futures and options. These derivatives are used to
modify the interest rate and/or currency characteristics of the borrowing portfolio and are linked to the related borrowings at
inception and remain so throughout the terms of their contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is recognized as an
adjustment to the borrowing cost over the life of the derivative contract and included in Interest under Borrowing Expenses on
the income statement. UIpon termination. the change in the derivative's market value is recorded as an adjustment to the
carrying value of the underlying borrowing and recognized as an adjustment of the borrowing cost over the remaining life of
the borrowing. In instances where the underlying borrowing is prepaid. the change in the associated derivative's market value
is recognized immediately as an adjustment to the cost of the underlying borrowing instrument and accordingly in the
determination of net income. Currency swap payables and receivables are recorded on a historical cost basis and are separate
items on the balance sheet. The notional principal on interest rate swaps is treated as an off-balance sheet item.
Fair Value Disclosures: Financial instruments for which mark-et quotations are available have been valued at the prevailing
market value. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using
methodologies and assurnptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not
determinable.
Accountintg and Reporting Developmnents
Accounting Jbr Transfers of Assets and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishinents of Liabilities: In June 1996 the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 125 entitled
'Accounting for Transfers of Assets and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" which included
provisions that were later deferred by SFAS No. 127. This statement deferred the provisions for transfers involving repurchase
agreements. securities borrowing/lending and collateral agreements for transfers of financial assets until January 1, 1998. Dur-
ing the third quarter of fiscal year 1998. IBRD adopted these provisions prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not
have a material impact on IBRD's financial statements.

Notes to Financial Statements
Reporting Comprehensive Income: In June 1997 the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". SFAS
No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses,
gains, and losses) in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. SFAS No. 130 defines comprehensive income as the
change in equity excluding all transactions with shareholders such as the issuance of stock. Comprehensive Income has two
major components: net income, and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes such items as unreal-
ized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation. This statement is effective for fiscal
years beginninga after December 15, 1997. Reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative
purposes is required. Adoption of this standard will have no effect on IBRD's reported results of operations or financial posi-
tion.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information: In June 1997 the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Dis-
closures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS No. 131 establishes the criteria for determining an
operating segment and the related financial information disclosure required. It also establishes standards for disclosing related
information regarding products and services, geographic areas and major customers. In August 1997 the International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) issued International Accounting Standard (IAS) 14 (revised), "Segment Reporting",
which requires disclosures of similar information. Both of these standards will be effective for IBRD's fiscal year ending June
30, 1999. Comparative information for earlier years will need to be restated. Adoption of these standards will have no effect on
IBRD's reported results of operations or financial position.
Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits: In February 1998 FASB issued SFAS No.132,
"Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits". This statement revises employers' disclosures
about pension and other postretirement benefits. It requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and
fair values of plan assets that will facilitate financial analysis, and eliminates certain disclosures that are no longer as useful.
This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. In addition, in February 1998, the IASC issued
IAS 19 (revised), "Employee Benefits", which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1999. This
standard limits the methods employed to calculate pension expense and requires certain disclosures regarding the calculation
of such expense. Adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material effect on IBRD's reported results of operations
or financial position.
Accounting fr Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: In June 1998 FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires a com-
pany to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instru-
ments at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. Since the statement significantly
changes the accounting treatment for derivative instruments and hedging activities, IBRD is in the process of evaluating the
potential impact of this standard on its financial position and results of operations.
Presentation of Financial Statements: In August 1997 IASC issued IAS No. 1 (revised), "Presentation of Financial State-
ments". IAS 1 (revised) is designed to improve the quality of financial statements presented using International Accounting
Standards by providing guidance on the structure of financial statements and establishing certain practical requirements. This
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1998. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
material effect on IBRD's reported results of operations or financial position.
Note A-Capital Stock, Restricted Currencies, Maintenance of Value, and Membership
Capital Stoc k: At June 30, 1998, IBRD's capital comprised 1,581,724 (1,558,478-June 30, 1997) authorized shares, of which
1.545,457 (1,512,211-June 30, 1997) shares had been subscribed. Each share has a par value of 0.1 million 1974 SDRs, val-
ued at the rate of $1.20635 per 1974 SDR. Of the subscribed capital, $11,288 million ($11,048 million-June 30, 1997) has

been paid in, and the remaining $175,148 million ($171,378 million-June 30. 1997) is subject to call only when required to
meet the obligations of IBRD created by borrowing or guaranteeing loans. As to $149,149 million ($145.940 million-June
30. 1997) the restriction on calls is imposed by the Articles of Agreement and as to $25,999 million ($25,438 million-June
30. 1997) by resolutions of the Board of Governors.
Restricted Currencies. A portion of capital subscriptions, paid in to IBRD. has been paid in the local currencies of the
members. These amounts, referred to as restricted currencies, are usable by IBRD in its lending operations only with the
consent of the respective members. and for administrative expenses.
Maintenance of Value: Of the total amount of $554 million included in Amounts to Maintain Value of Currency Holdings.
which has been deducted from equity. $86 million represents MOV receivables for countries that have amounts in arrears for
two years or more. IBRD still considers these MOV receivables in arrears as obligations due from the members concerned. The
remaining $468 million represents net MOV amounts relating to restricted currencies out on loan that become payable tinder
the same terms as other MOV payments only after such currencies are repaid to IBRD.
Memnbership: In February 1993 IBRD's Executive Directors decided that the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(SFRY) had ceased to be a member of IBRD and that the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (now called Bosnia and Herze-
govina). the Republic of Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Slovenia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY) are authorized to succeed to the SFRY's membership when certain
requirements are met, including entering into a final agreement with IBRD on IBRD's loans made to or guaranteed by the
SFRY which the particular successor Republic would assume. Four of the five successor Republics-Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia-have become members of IBRD. The paid-in portion of
the SFRY's subscribed capital allocated to the FRY is included under Payments on Account of Pending Subscriptions until the
requirements of succession are met.
Note B-Investmients
As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, IBRD invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits. asset-
backed securities and related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk including futures, forward contracts, currency
swaps. cross-currency interest rate swaps. interest rate swaps, options and short sales.
Goveriunent anid Agency Obligations: These obligations include marketable bonds, notes and other obligations. IBRD can
only invest in obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries with a minimum credit rating of
AA; however, if such obligations are denominated in the home currency of the issuer, no rating is required. IBRD can only
invest in obligations issued by an agency or instrumentality of a government of a country, a multilateral organization or any
other official entity with a minimum credit rating of AA.
Time Deposits: Time deposits include certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, and other obligations issued or uncondi-
tionally guaranteed by btnks and other financial institutions.
Asset-backed Securities: Asset-backed securities are instruments whose cash flow is based on the cash flows of a pool of
underlying assets managed by a trust. IBRD can only invest in such securities with a AAA credit rating.
Futures and Forwards: Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instru-
ments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument. at a specified price or
yield. Futures contracts are traded on regulated United States and international exchanges. IBRD generally closes out most
open positions in futures contracts prior to maturity. Therefore. cash receipts or payments are mostly limited to the change in
market value of the futures contracts. Futures contracts generally entail daily settlement of the net cash margin.

Notes; to Financial Statements
Options: Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a finan-
cial instrument at a specified price within a specified period of time from or to the seller of the option. The purchaser of an
option pays a premium at the outset to the seller of the option, who then bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of
the financia[ instrument underlying the option. IBRD only invests in exchange-traded options. The initial price of an option
contract is equal to the premium paid by the purchaser and is significantly less than the contract or notional amount. IBRD
does not write uncovered option contracts.
Repurchase and Resale Agreements and Securities Loans: Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells
securities and simultaneously agrees to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. The reverse of
this transaction is called a resale agreement. Securities loans are contracts under which securities are lent for a specified period
of time at a fixed price.
Short Sales. Short sales are sales of securities not held in IBRD's portfolio at the time of the sale. IBRD must purchase the
security at a later date and bears the risk that the market value of the security will move adversely between the time of the sale
and the time the security must be delivered.
Currency Swaps: Currency swaps are agreements between two parties to exchange cashflows denominated in different curren-
cies at one or more certain times in the future. The cashflows are based on a predetermined formula reflecting rates of interest
and an exchange of principal.
Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps: Cross-currency interest rate swaps are currency swaps where one set of cashflows
reflects a fixed rate of interest and the other reflects a floating rate of interest.
Interest Rate Swaps: Interest rate swaps are agreements which transform a fixed rate obligation in a particular currency into a
floating rate obligation in that currency or vice-versa.

Note C-Loans, Cofinancing and Guarantees
Multicurrency Loans
Fixed rate loanzs: On loans negotiated prior to July 1982, IBRD charges interest at fixed rates.
Adjustable rate loarns: In 1982 IBRD mitigated its interest rate risk by moving fromn fixed rate to adjustable rate lending. This
rate, reset twice a year, is based on IBRD' s own cost of qualified borrowings plus a 50 basis point spread, resulting in a pass-
through of its average borTowing costs to those members that benefit from IBRD loans.
Single Currency Loans
Fixed rate loan2s: IBRD introduced fixed rate single currency loans in 1995. The rates charged on fixed rate single currency
loans are set on semi-annual rate fixing dates for loan amounts disbursed during the preceding six-month period and remain
fixed for such disbursed amounts until they are repaid. For the interim period from the date each disbursement is made until its
rate fixing date, interest accrues at a variable rate equal to the rate on LIBOR-based single currency loans (PIBOR-based for
French franc denominated loans) applicable for such interim period. The fixed lending rate comprises a base rate reflecting
medium- to long-term market rates on the rate fixing date, plus a total spread consisting of (a) IBRD's funding cost margin for
these loans. ib) a risk premium (intended to compensate IBRD for market risks incurred in funding these loans). and (c) a
spread of 50 basis points.
LIBOR-based loans: IBRD introduced LIBOR-based single currency loans in 1993. The rates charged on LIBOR-based sin-
gle currency loans are a direct pass-through of IBRD's cost of funding for these loans, and are reset semi-annually. They com-
prise a base rate equal to the six-month reference interbank offered rate for the applicable currency on the rate reset date and a
total spread consisting of (a) IBRD's average funding cost margin for these loans and (b) a spread of 50 basis points.
IBRD has approved and disbursed two LIBOR-based single currency loans-one in December 1997 and the other in March
1998-that have non-standard financial terms.  The first, an economic reconstruction loan in an amount of $3,000 million,
carries a six-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed spread of 100 basis points. The second, a structural adjustment loan in an
amount of $2,000 million, carries a six-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed spread of 75 basis points. Both loans have a
loan origination charge. Neither loan is eligible for the waivers described below.

Waivers of Loan Interest and Charges
On July 31, 1997, IBRD's Executive Directors approved a one-year interest waiver of 25 basis points on disbursed and out-
standing loans for all payment periods commencing in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998 for all eligible borrowers. A similar
waiver of 25 basis points was in effect for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996. In fiscal year 1995 IBRD's
Executive Directors approved a one-time 10 basis point interest waiver, for two consecutive six-month interest periods, on
multicurrency pool loans which a borrower converts from loan interest rate terms in effect between 1982 and 1989 to interest
rate terms in effect since 1989. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, the combined effect of these waivers was to reduce Net
Income by $241 million ($259 million-June 30, 1997, $286 million-June 30, 1996).
Further, on J-ly 31, 1997, the Executive Directors approved a one-year commitmnent fee waiver of 50 basis points on undis-
bursed loans to all borrowers for all payment periods commencing in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998. A similar waiver of
50 basis points was in effect for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996. For the fiscal year ended June 30,
1998, the effect of the commitment fee waiver was to reduce Net Income by $211 million ($226 mitlion-June 30, 1997, $235
million-Jur[e 30, 1996).

a.  Average Maturity - Multicurrency loans. IBRD maintains a targeted currency composition in its multicurrency loans. The present
target ratio is one U.S. dollar for every 125 Japanese yen and two Deutsche mark equivalents (consisting of Deutsche mark,
Netherlands guilders and Swiss francs). These five major currencies comprise at least 90 percent of the multicurrency loans' U.S.
dollar equivalent value, with the remainder in other currencies. This ratio has been maintained since 1991, and is reviewed periodically.
The composition of the multicurrency loans is affected by the selection of currencies for disbursements on those loans and by the
currencies selected for the billing of the principal repayments. Along with the selection of disbursement currencies, IBRD manages the
selection of repayment currencies to maintain the alignment of the multicurrency loans' composition with the target ratio. The
selection of currencies for repayment billing by IBRD precludes the determination of average maturity information for multicurrency
loans by individual currency. Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the maturity periods for its multicurrency loans on a combined U.S.
dollars equivalent basis.

b   Avetrage Maturity - Single Currency Pools. Each single currency pool is a multicurrency at inception, but will be adjusted to reach a
level of at least 90% in the designated currency by July 1, 1999 and will be maintained at or above that level thereafter. The currency
comnposition of these single currency pools is affected by IBRD's management of the selection of repayment cur-encies to the extent
non-designated currencies remaining in these pools are selected for repayment. This varying selection of currencies f-or repayment
precludes the determination of average maturity information for the single currency pools loans by individual currencies. AccordinQly.

Estimated Value of Loans
AJl of IBRD's loans are made to or guaranteed by countries that are members of IBRD, except for those loans made to IFC.
IBRD does not currently sell its loans, nor is there a market of loans comparable to those made by IBRD.
Multicurrency loans and Single Currency Pools: The estimated value of fixed rate loans negotiated prior to July 1982 has
been based on discounted future cash flows using the rate at which IBRD could undertake borrowings of comparable maturi-
ties at June 30. 1998 plus a 50 basis point spread. The estimated value of adjustable rate multicurrency loans and single cur-
rency pools is based on the relationship of the fair value to the carrying value of the underlying qualified borrowings, since the
interest rate for such loans is based on the interest rate of the qualified borrowings.
Single Currency Loans: The estimated value of fixed rate single currency loans has been based on discounted future cash
flows using the rate at which IBRD could make similar loans of comparable maturities at June 30, 1998. The estimated value
of LIBOR-based single currency loans has been based on the relationship of the fair value to the carrying value of the underly-
ing borrowings funding these loans.
The following table reflects the carrying and estimated values of the loan portfolio based on current borrowing rates net of the

Cofinancing and Guarantees
IBRD has taken direct participations in, or provided partial guarantees of, loans syndicated by other financial institutions for
projects or programs also financed by IBRD through regular loans. IBRD also has provided partial guarantees of securities
issued by an entity eligible for IBRD loans. IBRD's partial guarantees of bond issues are included in the guarantees amount
mentioned below. IBRD's direct participations in syndicated loans are included in the reported loan balances.
Guarantees of loan principal of $2,047 million at June 30, 1998 ($1,593 million-June 30, 1997) were not included in reported
loan balances. At June 30. 1998, $371 million of these guarantees were subject to call ($148 million-June 30, 1997). IBRD
has partially guaranteed the timely payment of interest amounts on certain loans that have been sold. At June 30, 1998, these
guarantees, approximating $0.04 million ($0.5 million-June 30, 1997). were subject to call.
Overdue Amounts
At June 30. 1998. no loans payable to IBRD other than those referred to in the following paragraphs were overdue by more
than three months.
At June 30, 1998, the loins made to or guaranteed by certain member countries and the FRY with an aggregate principal bal-
ance outstanding of $2,044 million ($2,360 million-Junie 30, 1997), of which $1,142 million ($1,314 million-June 30,
1997) was overdue, were in nonaccrual status. At such date, overdue interest and other charges in respect of these loans totaled
$948 million ($893 million-June 30, 1997). If these loans had not been in nonaccrual status, income from loans for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998 would have been higher by $84 million ($146 million-June 30, 1997, $188 million-June 30,
1996).

On July 27, 1997, the Syrian Arab Republic and IBRD entered into an agreement covering, among other things, the application
of payments by Syria of its overdue principal, interest, and charges. Under this agreement, Syria paid the overdue principal to
IBRD in one payment of $263 million on September 2, 1997 and has been making monthly payments to IBRD since then.
On June 22, 1998, Sierra Leone paid off all its arrears and, as a result, its loans came out of nonaccrual status. Loans to Sierra
Leone had been in nonaccrual status since January 15, 1998. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, no loans came out of
nonaccrual status.
In connection with the cessation of the membership of the SFRY discussed in Note A, in February 1993 IBRD reached an
agreement with the FRY for the apportionment and service of debt due to IBRD on loans made to or guaranteed by the SFRY
and assumed by the FRY, which confirmed a February 1992 interim agreement between the SFRY (then consisting of the
Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) and IBRD pertaining, among other things, to such
loans. As of the date hereof, no debt-service payments have been received by IBRD from the FRY.
In June 1996 the accumulated arrears on loans to the former SFRY assumed by Bosnia and Herzegovina were cleared through
three new consolidation loans extended by IBRD. These new loans consolidated all outstanding principal and overdue interest
on the loans assumed by Bosnia and Herzegovina. This resulted in an increase in loans outstanding of $168 million and the
deferral of the recognition of the related interest income.

The average recorded investment in nonaccruing loans during the fiscal year ended June 30. 1998 was $2,138 million. ($2,430
million-June 30, 1997, $2,466 million-June 30, 1996).
Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses
IBRD has never suffered a loss on any of its loans, with the exception of losses resulting from the difference between the
present value of payments for interest and charges made according to the related loan's contractual terms and the present value
of its expected future cash flows. Certain borrowers have found it difficult to make timely payments for protracted periods.
resulting in their loans being placed in nonaccrual status. Several borrowers have emerged from nonaccrual status after a
period of time by bringiig up-to-date alt principal payments and all overdue service payments, including interest and other
charges. In an attempt tc recognize the risk inherent in these and any other potential overdue payments. IBRD inaintains an
accumulated provision for loan losses. Of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses of $3,240 million, $1.000 million is
attributable to the nonaccruing loan portfolio at June 30. 1998.

IBRD has endorsed a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of a group of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to ensure that the reform efforts of these countries will not be put at risk by unsustainable
external debt burdens. Under this initiative, creditors are to provide enhanced debt relief for those countries that demonstrated
good policy performance over an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. IBRD has taken the situa-
tion of these countries into account in its review of the adequacy of the Accumulated Provision for Loan Losses.
Fifth Dimension Program
Under IDA's Fifth Dimension program established in September 1988. a portion of principal repayments to IDA are allocated
on an annual basis to prox ide supplementary IDA credits to IDA-eligible countries that are no longer able to borrow on IBRD
terms. but have outstanding IBRD loans approved prior to September 1988 and have in place an IDA-supported structural
adjustment program. Such supplementary IDA credits are allocated to countries that meet specified conditions, in proportion to
each country's interest payments due that year on its pre-September 1988 IBRD loans. To be eligible for such IDA
supplemental credits, a member country must meet IDA's eligibility criteria for lending. must be ineligible for IBRD lending
and must not have had an IBRD loan approved within the last twelve months. To receive a supplemental credit from the
program, a member country cannot be more than 60 days overdue on its debt-service payments to IBRD or IDA. At June 30,
1998, IDA had approved credits of $1,590 million ($1,526 million-June 30, 1997) under this program from inception, of
which $1.531 million (.51,435 million-June 30, 1997) had been disbursed to the eligible countries.

Note D-Borrowings
Providing liquidity and minimizing the cost of funds are key objectives to IBRD's overall borrowing strategy. IBRD uses
swaps in its borrowing strategy to lower the overall cost of its borrowings for those members who benefit from IBRD loans.
IBRD undertakes swap transactions with a list of authorized counterparties. Credit limits have been established for each coun-
terparty.
Currency swaps: Currency swaps are agreements between two parties to exchange cashflows denominated in different
currencies at one or more certain times in the future. The cashflows are based on a predetermined formula reflecting rates of
interest and an exchange of principal.
Interest rate swaps: Interest rate swaps are agreements which transform a fixed rate payment obligation in a particular
currency into a floating rate obligation in that currency or vice-versa.
Forward interest rate swaps: A forward interest rate swap is an agreement under which the cash flow exchanges of the
underlying interest rate swaps would begin to take effect from a specified date.
Swaptions: A swaption is an option that gives the holder the right to enter into an interest rate or currency swap at a certain
future date.

The estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices where such prices are available. Where no quoted market price is
available, the fair value is estimated based on the cost at which IBRD could currently undertake borrowings with similar terms
and remaining maturities, using the secondary market yield curve. The fair value of swaps represents the estimated cost of
replacing these contracts on that date.
Note E-Credit Risk
Counittry Credit Risk: This risk includes potential losses arising from protracted arrears on payments from borrowers. IBRD
manages country credit risk through individual country exposure limits according to creditworthiness. These exposure limits
are tied to performance on macroeconomic and structural policies. In addition, IBRD establishes absolute limits on the share
of outstanding loans to any individual borrower. The country credit risk is further managed by financial incentives such as pric-
ing loans using IBRD's own cost of borrowing and partial interest charge waivers conditioned on timely payment that give bor-
rowers self-interest in IBRD's continued strong intermediation capacity. Collectibility risk is covered by the Accumulated
Provision for Loan Losses. IBRD also uses a simulation model to assess the adequacy of its reserves in the case a major bor-
rower, or group of borrowers, stops servicing its loans for an extended period of time.
Commercial Credit Risk: For the purpose of risk management, IBRD is party to a variety of financial instruments, certain of
which involve elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet. Credit risk exposure represents
the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the
contracts. Additionally. the nature of the instruments involve contract value and notional principal amounts that are not
reflected in the basic financial statements. For both on- and off-balance sheet securities, IBRD limits trading to a list of autho-
rized dealers and counterparties. Credit risk is controlled through application of eligibility criteria and volume limits for trans-
actions with individual counterparties and through the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions.
IBRD may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties in order to
mitigate its credit exposure.

Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
On July 31, 1997. the Executive Directors allocated $500 million of the net income earned in the fiscal year ended June 30.
1997 to the General Reserve and $112 million to the Pension Reserve, representing the difference between actual funding of
the Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) and the Plan's accounting expenses for the fiscal year 1997. This Pension Reserve would
be reduced if in any future fiscal year pension accounting expenses were to exceed the actual funding of the Plan. On Septem-
ber 25, 1997. the Board of Governors approved the following transfers out of unallocated Net Income: an amount equivalent to
$304 million in SDRs (valued at June 30, 1997) to IDA by way of grant, an immediate grant of $250 million to the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative Trust Fund, and $119 million to Surplus. On April 6. 1998, the Board of Governors
approved a transfer from Surplus. by way of grant, in the amount of $150 million to MIGA to be used as part of MIGA's capital
resources to strengthen its financial position. On July 13, 1998, the Board of Governors approved a transfer from Surplus. by
way of grant. in the amount of 590 million to the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank. As this transfer had not been approved
by the Board of Governors at June 30, 1998, no payable had been recognized at that date.
Transfers to Intern ationalDevelopmenttAssociationl: The Board of Governors had approved aggregate transfers through June
30, 1997 to IDA totaling $5,431 million from unallocated Net Income. On September 25, 1997, the Board of Governors
approved a transfer to ID9A. by way of grant, of $304 million in an equivalent amount in SDRs out of unallocated Net Income.
At June 30. 1998 and June 30. 1997. there were no payables to IDA.
Transfers to Debt Reduiction Facility for IDA-Onily Countries: The Board of Governors had approved aggregate transfers
through June 30, 1997 to the Debt Reduction Facility for IDA-Only Countries totaling $300 million. At June 30. 1998,
S100 million ($1 18 million-June 30, 1997) remained payable.
Transfer to Trufst Fundjfor Gaza and West Bank: The Board of Governors had approved aggregate transfers through June 30.
1997 to the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank. totaling $230 million. At June 30, 1998. $22 million ($83 million-June 30.

approved aggregate transfers to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund totaling $500 million. On September 25, 1997. the Board
of Governors approved a transfer to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, by way of grant, of $250 million out of unallocated
Net Income. At June 30. 1998 and June 30, 1997, there were no payables to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund.
Tiransfer-s to Mulltilateral Investinent Gutarantee Agency: On April 6. 1998, the Board of Governors approved a transfer from
Surplus. by way of grant, in the amount of $150 million to MIGA to be used as part of MIGA's capital resources to strengthen
its financial position. At June 30, 1998. there was no payable to MIGA.
Note G-Adminisitrative Expenses and Contributions to Special Programs
In fiscal year 1995 the Executive Directors authorized expenditures for costs associated with planned staff reductions. The cost
of this program charged through fiscal year 1997 was $112 million, of which $45 million was allocated to IDA. During the fis-
cal year ended June 30. 1998, all remaining staff previously identified for separation under this program began receiving sever-
ance payments. The total cost under this program was S87 million. The difference of $25 million has been taken back into
income as a reduction of administrative expenses, of which $10 million had been allocated to IDA as a reduction of the man-
agement fee charged to IDA. At June 30. 1998. $82 million ($64 million-June 30, 1997. $26 million-June 30, 1996) has
been charged against the accrual of $87 million. This accrual included costs associated with job search assistance. training.
outplacement consulting, pension plan contributions, medical insurance contributions and related tax allowances.
In March 1997 the Executive Directors approved a multiyear program of institutional renewal to improve IBRD's and IDA's
business processes, products and services, strengthen their human resources through more skilled and better trained staff, and
achieve a higher level of development effectiveness. Implementation of this program is expected to result in costs associated
with staff reductions during the fiscal years 1997 through 1999. Through June 30. 1998. 299 staff had been identified for sepa-

lative charge of $48 million, $19 million has been charged to IDA. Of the total fiscal year charge of $38 million, $15 million
has been charged to IDA for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, consistent with normal cost apportionment procedures
applied in the calculation of the management fee.

Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
The responsibilities of I BRD under these arrangements vary and range from services normally provided under its own lending
projects to full project implementation including procurement of goods and services. During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1998, IBRD received $14 million ($15 million-June 30. 1997 and 1996) as fees for administering trust funds. These fees
have been recorded as a reduction of Administrative Expenses.
Note I-Staff Retirement Plan
IBRD has a defined benefit retirement plan (the Plan) covering substantially all of its staff. The Plan also covers substantially
all the staff of IFC and MIGA. Under the Plan. benefits are based on the years of contributory service and the highest three-
year average of pensionable remuneration as defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable
remuneration, and IBRD contributing the remainder of the actuarially-determined cost of future Plan benefits. The actuarial
present values of P]an obligations throughout the fiscal year are determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's
actuary. All contributions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for the purposes of the Plan are held by IBRD
separately from the other assets and income of IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA and can be used only for the benefit of the
participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided for. Plan assets consist
primarily of equity and fixed income securities, with smaller holdings of cash, real estate and other investments.
Net periodic pension income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998, June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996 consisted of the

Prepaid pension cost .....................................................          $   553             $  213
Of the $553 million prepaid at June 30, 1998 ($213 million-June 30, 1997), $295 million is attributable to IBRD ($112
million-June 30, 1997) and is included in Miscellaneous Assets on the balance sheet. The remainder has been attributed to
IDA, IFC and MIGA.
The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was
6.5 percent (7.5 percent-June 30, 1997). The effect of projected compensation levels was calculated based on a scale that
provides for a decreasing rate of salary increase depending on age, beginning with 11.0 percent (11.0 percent-June 30, 1997)
at age 20 arid decreasing to 4.5 percent (5.5 percent-June 30, 1997) at age 64. The expected long-term rate of return on assets
was 9 percent (9 percent-June 30, 1997).
Note J--Other Postretirement Benefits
IBRD provides other postretirement benefits for eligible active and retired staff through a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP)
that has several accounts. These benefits can be grouped in accounts under the RSBP of two major types, i.e., health insurance
and life insurance benefits and pension benefits administered outside the Staff Retirement Plan (discussed in Note I). IBRD
has designated assets to fund these liabilities (see Note B).
Health Insurance and Life Insurance Accounts (HILI): IBRD funds certain health insurance and life insurance benefits to
retirees under the HILI accounts of the RSBP. All staff who are enrolled in the insurance programs while in active service and
who meet certain requirements are eligible for benefits when they reach early or normal retirement age while working for
IBRD.
Retirees contribute a level amount toward life insurance based on the amount of coverage. Retiree contributions toward health
care are based on length of service and age at retirement. The actuarial present values of HILI obligations throughout the fiscal
year are det ermined at the beginning of the fiscal year.

Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)
Supplemental Staff RetireMent Plani Accounts (SSRP): IBRD has Supplemental Staff Retirement Plan Accounts which cover
pensions payable in addition to those under the Staff Retirement Plan to eligible retirees.
All contributions to the HILL and the SSRP and all other assets and income held for purposes of the HILl and SSRP are held by
IBRD separately from the other assets and income of IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA. HILI and SSRP assets consist primarily of
fixed income and equity securities. The assets are designated to be utilized to meet IBRD's liabilities under the HILI and
SSRP. The value of the assets at June 30, 1998, is 51,456 million (see Note B).
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. IBRD reviewed the status of the HILI and SSRP accounts and determined that the
assets and liabilities did not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting under SFAS 10(6 or SFAS 87. At June 30. 1998. the assets
and liabilities were recorded on IBRD's balance sheet resulting in income to IBRD of $113 million, of which $56 million
related to the cumulative effect of prior periods on retained earnings at June 30, 1997, and has been included in Effect of
Accounting Change on the income statement. The portions of the net assets attributable to IDA ($138 million-June 30, 1998).
IFC ($72 million-June 30. 1998) and MIGA (S2 million-June 30, 1998) have been included in Accounts Payable and
Miscellaneous Liabilities on the balance sheet. For the fiscal year ended June 30. 1998. the management fee charged to IDA
was reduced by $67 million representing IDA's share of the income.
The following table sets forth the HILl's and SSRP's status at June 30. 1998 and June 30, 1997:

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, health care cost trend rates were reduced after completing a five years' experience
study, reducing the accrued liability at June 30, 1998, from $808 million to $619 million. This change in the health care cost
trend rate resulted in income of $104 million for IBRD. which has been included in Effect of Accounting Change on the
income statement. The balance is attributable to IDA, IFC, and MIGA.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, including the summary statement of loans and the statement of subscriptions to capital
stock and voting power, as of June 30, 1998. and the related statements of income, changes in retained
earnings, changes in cumulative translation adjustment, and cash flows for the year then ended. These
financial statements are included in the Annual Report on pages 207 to 253. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial
statements of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the years ended June 30,
1997 and 1996 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated July 28, 1997, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of
America and with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that wve plan and perform
the audit lo obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management. as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In oor opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as of June 30, 1998, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America and with International Accounting Standards.

Notes to Special Purpose Financial Statements
Note A-Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting and Related Policies
Purpose aind Affiliated Organizations
The International Development Association (IDA) is an international organization established on September 24, 1960 to
promote economic development in the less developed areas of the world included in IDA's membership by providing financing
on concessionary terms. IDA has three affiliated organizations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Each of
these organizations is legally and financially independent from IDA, with separate assets and liabilities, and IDA is not liable
for their respective obligations. The principal purpose of IBRD is to promote the economic development of its member
countries, primarily by providing loans and related technical assistance for specific projects and for programs of economic
reform in developing member countries. IFC's purpose is to encourage the growth of productive private enterprises in its
member countries through loans and equity investments in such enterprises without a member's guarantee. MIGA was
established to encourage the flow of investments for productive purposes among member countries and, in particular, to help
developing member countries by providing guarantees against noncommercial risks for foreign investment in its developing
member countries.
Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies
Due to the nature and organization of IDA, these financial statements have been prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting
the sources and applications of member subscriptions and contributions and are not intended to be a presentation in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or with International Accounting Standards. These special
purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article VI, Section 11(a) of the Articles of Agreement of
IDA.
IDA's special purpose financial statements are prepared in accordance with the accounting policies outlined below.
Certain reclassifications of the prior years' information have been made to conform to the current year's presentation.
Basis of Accounting
IDA's special purpose financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. That is, the effects of transactions
and other events are recognized when they occur (and not as cash or its equivalent is received or paid) and are recorded in the
accounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.
Translation of Currencies
IDA's special purpose financial statements are expressed in terms of U.S. dollars solely for the purpose of summarizing IDA's
financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its members and other interested parties.
IDA is an international organization which conducts its operations in the currencies of all of its members. Development
resources and sources of development resources are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the accounting
period, except Member Subscriptions and Contributions which are translated in the manner described below. Income and
expenses are translated at either the market exchange rates in effect at the dates on which they are recognized, or at an average
of the market exchange rates in effect during each month. Translation adjustments relating to the revaluation of development
credits denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are charged or credited to Cumulative Translation Adjustment on
Development Credits. Other translation adjustments are charged or credited to the Accumulated Surplus.

Notes to Special Purpose Financial Statements (Continued)
Member Subscriptions and Contributions
Recognition
Member Subscriptions and Contributions for each IDA replenishment are recorded in full as Subscriptions and Contributions
Committed upon effectiveness of the relevant replenishment. Replenishments become effective when IDA has received
commitments from members for subscriptions and contributions of a specified portion of the full replenishment. Amounts not
yet paid in, at the date of effectiveness, are recorded as Subscriptions and Contributions Receivable and shown as a reduction
of Subscriptions and Contributions Committed. These receivables come due throughout the replenishment period (generally
three years) in accordance with an agreed maturity schedule. The actual payment of receivables when they become due from
certain members is conditional upon the respective member's budgetary appropriation processes.
The Subscriptions and Contributions Receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of nonnegotiable, noninterest-
bearing demand notes. If the receivable is settled in cash, the cash is recorded in Cash and Investments Not Immediately
Available for Disbursement, until such time as it becomes available in accordance with the replenishment agreement. The
notes are encashed by IDA as provided in the relevant replenishment resolution over the disbursement period of the credits
committed under the replenishment and the cash received is recorded in Cash and Investments Immediately Available for
Disbursement.
In certain replenishments, donors have had the option of paying all of their subscription and contribution amount in cash
before it becomes due and receiving a discount. In these cases, IDA and the donor agree that IDA will invest the cash and retain
the income. The related subscription and contribution is recorded at the full undiscounted amount. The cash and investments
are recorded in Cash and Investments Not Immediately Available for Disbursement until the relevant due date, at which time
the cash and investments become available. The discount is recorded in Subscriptions and Contributions Receivable and
amortized over the projected encashment period.
Under the Articles of Agreement and the arrangements goveming replenishments, IDA must take appropriate steps to ensure
that, over a reasonable period of time, the resources provided by donors for lending by IDA are used on an approximately pro
rata basis. As discussed in the previous paragraph, donors sometimes contribute resources substantially ahead of their pro rata
share. Unless otherwise agreed, IDA does not disburse these funds ahead of donors' pro rata shares. Cash and Investments Not
Immediately Available for Disbursement represents the difference between the amount contributed and the amount available
for disbursements on a pro rata basis.
Transfers to IDA from IBRD are recorded as Sources of Development Resources and are receivable upon approval by IBRD's
Board of Govemors.
For the purposes of its financial resources, the membership of IDA is divided into two categories: (1) Part I members, which
make payments of subscriptions and contributions provided to IDA in convertible currencies which may be freely used or
exchanged by IDA in its operations and (2) Part II members, which make payments of ten percent of their initial subscriptions
in freely convertible currencies, and the remaining ninety percent of their initial subscriptions, and all additional subscriptions
and contributions in their own currencies or in freely convertible currencies. Certain Part II members provide a portion of their
subscriptions and contributions in the same manner as mentioned in (1) above. IDA's Articles of Agreement and subsequent
replenishment agreements provide that the currency of any Part II member paid in by it may not be used by IDA for projects
financed by IDA and located outside the territory of the member except by agreement between the member and IDA. The cash
paid and notes deposited in nonconvertible local currencies for the subscriptions of Part II members are recorded in Restricted
Cash and Notes.

Notes to Special Purpose Financial Statements
Valuation
The subscriptions and contributions provided through the Third Replenishment are expressed in terms of "U.S. dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960" (1960 dollars). Following the abolition of gold as a common denominator of
the monetary system and the repeal of the provision of the U.S. law defining the par value of the U.S. dollar in terms of gold,
the pre-existing basis for translating 1960 dollars into current dollars or any other currency disappeared. The Executive
Directors of IDA have decided, with effect on that date and until such time as the relevant provisions of the Articles of
Agreement are amended, that the words "U.S. dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960" in Article II,
Section 2(b) of the Articles of Agreement of IDA are interpreted to mean the SDR introduced by the International Monetary
Fund as the SDR was valued in terms of U.S. dollars immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the
SDR on July 1, 1974, such value being equal to $1.20635 for one SDR (the 1974 SDR), and have also decided to apply the
same standard of value to amounts expressed in 1960 dollars in the relevant resolutions of the Board of Governors.
The subscriptions and contributions provided through the Third Replenishment are expressed on the basis of the 1974 SDR.
Prior to the decision of the Executive Directors, IDA had valued these subscriptions and contributions on the basis of the SDR
at the current market value of the SDR.
The subscriptions and contributions provided under the Fourth Replenishment and thereafter are expressed in members'
currencies or SDRs and are payable in members' currencies. Beginning July 1, 1986, subscriptions and contributions made
available for disbursement in cash to IDA are translated at market exchange rates in effect on the dates they were made
available. Prior to that date, subscriptions and contributions which had been disbursed or converted into other currencies were
translated at market exchange rates in effect on dates of disbursement or conversion. Subscriptions and contributions not yet
available for disbursements are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the accounting period.
Article IV, Section 2(a) and (b) of IDA's Articles of Agreement provides for maintenance of value payments on account of the
local currency portion of the initial subscription whenever the par value of the member's currency or its foreign exchange value
has, in the opinion of IDA, depreciated or appreciated to a significant extent within the member's territories, so long as, and to
the extent that, such currency shall not have been initially disbursed or exchanged for the currency of another member. The
provisions of Article IV, Section 2(a) and (b) have by agreement been extended to cover additional subscriptions and
contributions of IDA through the Third Replenishment, but are not applicable to those of the Fourth and subsequent
replenishments.
The Executive Directors decided on June 30, 1987 that settlements of maintenance of value, which would result from the
resolution of the valuation issue on the basis of the 1974 SDR, would be deferred until the Executive Directors decide to
resume such settlements. These amounts are shown as Deferred Amounts Receivable to Maintain Value of Currency Holdings.
Development Credits
All development credits are made to or guaranteed by member governments or to the government of a territory of a member
(except for development credits which have been made to regional development banks for the benefit of members or territories
of members of IDA). In order to qualify for lending on IDA terms, a country's per capita income must be below a certain level
and the country may have only limited or no creditworthiness for IBRD lending. Development credits carry a service charge of
0.75 percent and generally have 35- or 40-year final maturities and a 10-year grace period for principal payments.
Development credits are carried in the Special Purpose Financial Statements at the full face amount of the borrowers'
outstanding obligations.
It is the practice of IDA to place in nonaccrual status all development credits made to a member government or to the
government of a territory of a member if principal or charges with respect to any such development credit are overdue by more
than six months, unless IDA's management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. In
IDA SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 271



Notes to Special Purpose Financial Statements (Continued)
addition, if loans by IBRD to a member government are placed in nonaccrual status, all development credits to that member
government will also be placed in nonaccrual status by IDA. On the date a member's development credits are placed in
nonaccrual status, charges that had been accrued on development credits outstanding to the member which remained unpaid
are deducted from the income from development credits of the current period. Charges on nonaccruing development credits are
included in income only to the extent that payments have actually been received by IDA. If collectibility risk is considered to
be particularly high at the time of arrears clearance, the member's credits may not automatically emerge from nonaccrual
status, even though the member's eligibility for new credits may have been restored. A decision on the restoration of accrual
status is made on a case-by-case basis after a suitable period of payment performance has passed from the time of arrears
clearance.
In fulfilling its mission, IDA makes concessional loans to the poorest countries, therefore there is significant credit risk in the
portfolio of development credits. Management continually monitors this credit risk. However, no provision for credit losses
has been established because it is not practicable to determine such an amount in view of the nature and maturity structure of
the credit portfolio. Should actual losses occur, they would be charged against IDA's Sources of Development Resources.
The repayment obligations of IDA's development credits funded from resources through the Fifth Replenishment are expressed
in the development credit agreements in terms of 1960 dollars. In June 1987 the Executive Directors decided to value those
development credits at the rate of $1.20635 per 1960 dollar on a permanent basis. Development credits funded from resources
provided under the Sixth Replenishment and thereafter are denominated in SDRs; the principal amounts disbursed under such
development credits are to be repaid in currency amounts currently equivalent to the SDRs disbursed.
Development Grants
The Eleventh Replenishment Resolution authorizes the use of Eleventh Replenishment donor funds to finance IDA
development grants in the context of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. The fiscal year 1997 net
income transfer from IBRD also authorizes the use of such funds for IDA development grants.
Development grants are accrued by IDA upon their commitment.
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative
IDA participates in a mulitilateral initiative (the HIPC Debt Initiative) to ensure that reform efforts of countries identified as
HIPCs will not be put at risk by unsustainable external debt burdens. Under the HIPC Debt Initiative, creditors are to provide
enhanced debt relief for those countries that have demonstrated good policy performance over an extended period in order to
bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund was established on
November 7, 1996, constituted by funds of donors including the IBRD, to help beneficiaries reduce their overall debt,
including IDA debt. The HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund is administered by IDA. IDA has not contributed to the HIPC Debt
Initiative Trust Fund.
Upon the signature of the ]IIPC Debt Relief Agreement between the member country and IDA, development credits identified
for sale are written down to their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to
reflect the actual difference between the cash received and the carrying value of the development credits sold. For the purposes
of the HIPC Debt Relief Agreement, IDA acts both in its own capacity and as Administrator of the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust
Fund.

Investments
IDA carries its investment securities and related financial instruments at market value. Both realized and unrealized gains and
losses are included in Income from Investments.
Interim Trust Fund
The Interim Trust Fund, established by IDA's Board of Governors in June 1996 as a part of the Eleventh Replenishment, is
administered by IDA to help fund operations approved during the period July 1, 1996 to June 30, 1997, as well as certain
additional operations approved after July 1, 1997. The development resources of the Interim Trust Fund have a separate legal,
procurement and accounting status. Credits financed by the Interim Trust Fund are made on the same terms and conditions as
those of IDA credits with two exceptions. First, eligibility for procurement under the Interim Fund Credits is extended only to
nationals of countries that either have contributed to the Interim Trust Fund or are eligible to borrow from IBRD or IDA.
Second, the Interim Fund Credits are approved by IDA's President after consultation with a committee of IDA's Executive
Directors representing the donors and eligible borrowers. Effective December 31, 1997, procurement restrictions were lifted
from SDR 700 million in Interim Trust Fund contributions that were unallocated. Charges paid by borrowers on Interim Fund
credits are received by IDA to compensate it for its services as administrator. The Interim Trust Fund is expected to be
terminated when the credits it financed have been substantially disbursed. Upon termination, its assets and liabilities will be
transferred to IDA.
Note B-investments
As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, IDA invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits and
related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.
Government and Agency Obligations: These obligations include marketable bonds, notes and other obligations. Obligations
issued or unconditionally guaranteed by govemments of countries require a minimum credit rating of AA if denominated in a
currency other than the home currency of the issuer, otherwise no rating is required. Obligations issued by an agency or
instrumentality of a govemment of a country, a multilateral organization or any other official entity require a credit rating of
AAA.
Time Deposits: Time deposits include certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, and other obligations issued or
unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions.
Futures and Forwards: Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market
instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price
or yield. Futures contracts are traded on regulated United States and intemational exchanges. IDA generally closes out most
open positions in futures contracts prior to maturity. Therefore, cash receipts or payments are mostly limited to the change in
market value of the futures contracts. Futures contracts generally entail daily settlement of the net cash margin.
Currency Swaps: Currency swaps are agreements in which two counterparties exchange specific amounts of two different
currencies at the outset and which repay over time according to a predetermined rule that reflects interest payments and
possibly amortization of principal. IDA is authorized to enter into currency swaps for periods not exceeding one year,
including covered forwards.
Options: Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option the right, but not the obligation to purchase or sell a financial
instrument at a specified price within a specified period of time from or to the seller of the option. The purchaser of an option
pays a premium at the outset to the seller of the option, who then bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the
IDA SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 273



Notes to Special Purpose Financial Statements (Continued)
financial instrument underlying the option. IDA only invests in exchange-traded options. The initial price of an option contract
is equal to the premium paid by the purchaser and is significantly less than the contract or notional amount. IDA does not write
uncovered option contracts.
Short Sales: Short sales are sales of securities not held in IDA's portfolio at the time of the sale. IDA must purchase the
security at a later date and bears the risk that the market value of the security will move adversely between the time of the sale
and the time the security must be delivered.
Repurchase and Resale Agreements and Securities Loans: Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells
securities and simultaneously agrees to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. The reverse of
this transaction is called a resale agreement. Securities loans are contracts under which securities are lent for a specified period
of time at a fixed price.

For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial instruments, certain of which involve elements of
credit risk in excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Sources and Applications of Development Resources. Credit
risk exposure represents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors and
counterparties under the terms of the contracts. Additionally, the nature of the instruments involve contract value and notional
principal amounts that are not reflected in the basic financial statements. For both on- and off-balance sheet securities, IDA
limits trading to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties. Credit limits have been established for each counterparty by
type of instrument and maturity category.
The credit risk exposure and contract value, as applicable, of these financial instruments at June 30, 1998 and June 30. 1997
are given below:

Eleventh Replenishment:  In June 1996 the Board of Governors of IDA adopted resolutions authorizing the Eleventh
Replenishment of IDA's resources. The Eleventh Replenishment, which provides IDA with resources to fund credits and grants
committed during the period July 1, 1996 to June 30, 1999, became effective on February 12, 1998. The total amount of donor
contributions pledged during this period, including supplementary contributions provided by certain members, is equivalent to
SDR 6,929 million. Certain procurement restrictions apply to Eleventh Replenishment Credits financed by donor funds. As
part of the Eleventh Replenishment, an Interim Trust Fund consisting of donor contributions pledged equivalent to SDR 2,228
million has been established and is administered by IDA.
Membership: In February 1993 the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ceased to be a member of IDA due to the
cessation of its membership in IBRD. Four of the five successor Republics-Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia,
the Republic of Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia-have since become members of IDA. At June 30,
1998, the subscription and contributions allocated to the other successor country, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro), are included under Payments on Account of Pending Membership.
Note D-Transfers from IBRD
IBRD's Board of Governors had approved aggregate transfers to IDA totaling $5,735 million through June 30, 1998 ($5,431)
million-June 30, 1997).

Note E-Development Credits
At June 30, 1998, principal installments of $4 million and charges of $2 million payable to IDA on development credits, other
than those referred to in the following paragraph, were overdue by more than three months and the aggregate amounts
outstanding on these development credits were $505 million.
At June 30, 1998, the development credits made to or guaranteed by certain member countries with an aggregate principal
balance outstanding of $3,723 million ($3,235 million-June 30, 1997), of which $160 million ($130 million-June 30, 1997)
was overdue, were in nonaccrual status. At such date, overdue charges in respect of these development credits totaled $127
million ($108 million-June 30, 1997). If these development credits had not been in nonaccrual status, income from
development credits for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 would have been higher by $24 million ($24 million-June 30,
1997 and $24 million-June 30, 1996), which is net of charges received from such members during the period. A summary of
member countries with credits or guarantees in nonaccrual status is as follows:

Total ......................................           $3,723          $287
On July 27, 1997, the Syrian Arab Republic and IDA entered into an agreement covering, among other things, the application
of Syria's overdue principal and charges. Under this agreement, Syria paid all its overdue principal and charges by October 31,
1997.
On June 22, 1998, Sierra Leone paid off all of its arrears and, as a result, its credits came out of nonaccrual status.
Development credits made to or guaranteed by Sierra Leone had been in nonaccrual status since January 15, 1998. During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, no development credits came out of nonaccrual status.
Under the Fifth Dimension program established in September 1988, a portion of principal repayments to IDA is allocated on
an annual basis to provide supplementary IDA credits to IDA-eligible countries that are no longer able to borrow on IBRD
terms but have outstanding IBRD loans approved prior to September 1988 and have in place an IDA-supported structural
adjustment program. Such supplementary IDA credits are allocated to countries that meet specified conditions, in proportion to
each country's interest payments due that year on its pre-September 1988 IBRD loans. To be eligible for such IDA
278 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 1998



Notes 1o Special Purpose Financial Statements
supplemental credits, a member country must meet IDA's eligibility criteria for lending, must be ineligible for IBRD lending
and must not have had an IBRD loan approved within the last twelve months. To receive a supplemental credit from the
program, a member country cannot be more than 60 days overdue on its debt-service payments to IBRD or IDA.
A summary of cumulative IDA credits committed and disbursed under this program from inception at June 30, 1998 and
June 30, 1997 is given below:
In millions
1998         1997
Commitments ..................................    $1,590        $1,526
Less: Undisbursed ..................................  59           91
Disbursed and Outstanding ..................................   $1,531  $1,435
Note F-Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Investments: Since IDA carries its investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of the portfolio.
These fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. The fair value of short-term financial instruments approximates
their carrying value.
Development Credits: IDA development credits have a significant grant element because of the concessional nature of IDA's
terms. Discounting IDA's credits using the standard 10 percent discount rate of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development provides an estimate for the grant element of IDA credits.
Using the 10 percent DAC discount rate indicates that the typical IDA credit contains a grant element of 75 percent to 80
percent of the nominal credit amount at the time the credit is committed. This grant element calculation considers interest
rates, maturity structures and grace periods for the credits. It does not consider credit risk, portfolio seasoning, multilateral and
sovereign credit preferences and other risks or indicators that would be relevant in calculating fair value. Estimating the
impact of these factors is not practicable. However, the fair value of Development Credits outstanding is substantially lower
than the $78,016 million reflected on the Statement of Sources and Applications of Development Resources at June 30, 1998.
Note G--lncome and Expenses
IDA receives charges paid by borrowers on Interim Fund Credits as compensation for its services as administrator.
IDA pays a management fee to IBRD representing its share of the administrative expenses incurred by IBRD. The
management fee for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 was reduced by $114 million ($72 million-June 30, 1997), allocated
from IBRD resulting from a re-evaluation of IBRD's pension expense methodology during fiscal year 1997. For the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1996, the management fee included $36 million of pension expense.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, the status of the other postretirement benefits was reviewed by IBRD and it was
determined that the assets and liabilities associated with these postretirement benefits did not qualify for off-balance sheet
accounting. At June 30, 1998, these assets and liabilities were recorded on IBRD's balance sheet. As a result of this change,
the management fee for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 was reduced by $133 million representing IDA's share of this
reduction.

Note H-Trust Funds
IDA, alone or jointly with IBRD. administers on behalf of donors, including members, their agencies and other entities, funds
restricted for specific uses which include the cofinancing of IDA lending projects. debt reduction operations for IDA members,
technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies and project preparation, global and regional programs and
research and training programs. These funds are placed in trust and are not included in the development resources of IDA. At
June 30, 1998 and June 30. 1997. the distribution of trust fund assets by executing agent is as follows:

The responsibilities of IDA under these arrangements vary and range from services normally provided under its own lending
projects to full project implementation including procurement of goods and services. IDA receives fees for administering trust
funds as a reduction of the Management Fee Charged by IBRD. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, IDA received
$8.9 million ($11 million-June 30, 1997, $ 10 million-June 30, 1996) as fees for administering trust funds.

Sale of IDA Development Credits
IDA sells specific development credits to the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund for cash at a price equivalent to the net present
value of the development credits, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the HIPC Debt Initiative. Following the
signature of the HIPC Debt Relief Agreement the development credits identified for sale are written down to their estimated
net present value. The amount of this write-down is shown as a reduction in Sources of Development Resources. The HIPC
Debt Initiative Trust Fund cancels these development credits.

President and Board of Governors
International Development Association
We have audited the special-purpose statement of sources and applications of development resources, the
summary statement of development credits and the statement of voting power and subscriptions and
contributions of the International Development Association, as of June 30, 1998, and the related special-
purpose statements of changes in resources used for heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative, of
cumulative translation adjustment on development credits, of accumulated surplus and of cash flows for
the year then ended. These financial statements are included in the Annual Report on pages 255 to 281.
These financial statements are the responsibilitv of the International Development Association's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit.
The special-purpose financial statements of the International Development Association for the year ended
June 30, 1997 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated Julv 28, 1997, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those statements and included an explanatory paragraph which described the basis of
accounting discussed in Note A to the financial statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of
America and with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying special-purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and
applications of development resources and development credits, voting power, and subscriptions and
contributions of the International Development Association to comply with Article VI, Section I 1(a) of
the Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association, as discussed in Note A to the
special-purpose financial statements, and are not intended to be a presentation in conformitv with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America or with International
Accounting Standards.
In our opinion, such special-purpose financial statements referred to above present fairlv, in all material
respects, the sources and applications of development resources, the development credits, voting power,
and subscriptions and contributions of the International Development Association at June 30, 1998, and
the changes in its resources used for heavily indebted poor countries, cumulative translation adjustment
and its cash flows for the year then ended, on the basis of accounting described in Note A.
This report is intended solely for the information of the Board of Governors, management and members
of the International Development Association.  However, under the International Development
Association's Articles of Agreement, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not
limited.

Notes to Special Purpose Financial Statements
Note A-Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting and Related Policies
Purpose
The Interim Trust Fund became effective on November 14, 1996.
The Interim Trust Fund, established by IDA's Board of Governors in June 1996. is administered by IDA to help fund
operations approved dur:ng the period July 1. 1996 to June 30, 1997, as well as certain additional operations approved after
July 1. 1997. The funds of the Interim Trust Fund have a separate legal, procurement and accounting status. Credits financed
by the Interim Trust Fund are made on the same terms and conditions as those of IDA credits with two exceptions. First,
eligibility for procurement under the Interim Fund Credits is extended only to nationals of countries that either have
contributed to the Interim Trust Fund or are eligible to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) or IDA. Second. the Interim Fund Credits are approved by IDA's President after consultation with a
committee of IDA's Executive Directors representing the donors and eligible borrowers. Effective December 31. 1997,
procurement restrictions were lifted from SDR 700 million in Interim Trust Fund contributions that were unallocated. Charges
paid by borrowers on Interim Fund Credits are received by IDA to compensate it for its services as administrator.
The Interim Trust Fund is expected to be terminated when the credits it financed have been substantially disbursed. Utpon
termination, its assets ancd liabilities will be transferred to IDA. Voting rights in IDA on account of contributions made to the
Interim Trust Fund will be allocated to contributors upon termination of the Interim Trust Fund.
Summary of Signiflicant Accounting and Related Policies
Due to the nature of the Interim Trust Fund, these financial statements have been prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting
the sources and applications of contributions and are not intended to be a presentation in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States or with International Accounting Standards. These special purpose financial
statements have been prepared consistent with Article VI. Section I I (a) of the Articles of Agreement of IDA. and Section 2(e)
of the Board of Governors' Resolution establishing the Interim Trust Fund.
The Interim Trust Fund's special purpose financial statements are prepared in accordance with the accounting policies outlined
below.
Basis of Accounting
The Interim Trust Fund's special purpose financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. That is, the
effects of transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not when cash or its equivalent is received or
paid) and are recorded in the accounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.
Translation of Currencies
The Interim Trust Fund's special purpose financial statements are expressed in terms of U.S. dollars solely tor the purpose of
summarizing the Interim Trust Fund's financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its donors and
other interested parties.
The Interim Trust Fund conducts its operations in the various currencies contributed to it. Developmenit resources are
translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the accounting period. Contributions are translated in the manner
described below. Income and expenses are translated either at the market exchange rates in effect at the dates on which they are
recognized. or at an average of the market exchange rates in effect during each month. Translation adjustments relating to the
revaluation of Interim Fund Credits denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are charged or credited to Cumulative
290 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL. REPORT 1998



Notes Ito Special Purpose Financial Statements
Translation Adjustment on Interim Fund Credits. Other translation adjustments are charged or credited to the Accumulated
Surplus.
Contributions
Contributions to the Interim Trust Fund are paid in cash and nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing demand notes. The demand
notes are encashed by IDA, on behalf of the Interim Trust Fund, on an approximately pro rata basis among donors, at
reasonable intervals over the projected encashment period (approximately seven years) to meet the Interim Trust Fund's
operational commitments.
Interim Trust Fund contributions are expressed and are payable in contributors' currencies, freely convertible currencies and
SDRs. Contributions made available for disbursement in cash are translated at market exchange rates in effect on the dates they
were made available. Contributions not yet available for disbursements are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the
end of the accounting period.
Interim Fund Credits
Interim Fund Credits finance specific development projects or programs. The policies, practices and procedures governing the
allocation of Interim Trust Fund resources, the selection and appraisal of projects or programs to be financed out of such
resources and the approval and administration of Interim Fund Credits, including the terms and conditions thereof, are the
same as those applicable with respect to development credits made under IDA's Eleventh Replenishment with the two
aforementioned exceptions.
Interim Fund Credits are denominated in SDRs and are to be repaid in currency amounts currently equivalent to the SDRs
disbursed. Plrincipal repayments of Interim Fund Credits will be part of the resources of the Interim Trust Fund until it is
terminated.
It is the practice to place in nonaccrual status all Interim Fund Credits made to a member government or to the government of
a territory of a member if principal or charges with respect to any such Interim Fund Credits are overdue by more than six
months, unless IDA management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. In addition, if
loans by IBRD or development credits by IDA to a member government are placed in nonaccrual status, all Interim Fund
Credits to that member government will also be placed in nonaccrual status by the Interim Trust Fund. On the date a member's
Interim Fund Credits are placed in nonaccrual status, charges that had been accrued by IDA, as administrator, on Interim Fund
Credits outstanding to the member which remained unpaid are deducted from IDA's income from development credits of the
culrent period. Charges on nonaccruing development credits are included in IDA's income only to the extent that payments
have actually been received by IDA. If collectibility risk is considered to be particularly high at the time of arrears clearance
the member's Interim Fund Credits may not automatically emerge from nonaccrual status, even though its eligibility for new
Interim Fund Credits may have been restored. A decision on the restoration of accrual status is made on a case-by-case basis
after a suitable period of payment performance has passed from the time of arrears clearance.
Investments
The Interim Trust Fund carries its investment securities and related financial instruments at market value. Both realized and
unrealized gains and losses are included in Income from Investments.

Note D-Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Investments: Since the Interim Trust Fund carries its investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value
of the portfolio. These fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. The fair value of short-term financial
instruments approximates their carrying value.
Interim Fund Credits: Interim Fund Credits have a significant grant element because of the concessional nature of their
terms. Discounting the Interim Fund Credits using the standard 10 percent discount rate of the Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development provides an estimate for the grant element
of Interim Fund Credits. Using the 10 percent DAC discount rate indicates that the typical Interim Fund Credit contains a grant
element of 75 percent to 80 percent of the nominal credit amount at the time the credit is committed. This grant element
calculation considers interest rates, maturity structures and grace periods for the credits. It does not consider credit risk,
portfolio seasoning, multilateral and sovereign credit preferences and other risks or indicators that would be relevant in
calculating fair value. Estimating the impact of these factors is not practicable. However, the fair value of Interim Fund Credits
outstanding is substantially lower than the $331.0 million reflected on the Statement of Sources and Applications of
Development Resources.
Note E--lnterim Fund Credits
At June 30, 1998, Interim Fund Credits made to or guaranteed by Bosnia and Herzegovina with an aggregate principal balance
outstandinz of $35.4 million, ($5.2 million-June 30, 1997) none of which was overdue, were in nonaccrual status, consistent
with IBRE' and IDA policy by which all Bosnia and Herzegovina debt to these organizations is in nonaccrual status.
Note F--lncome and Expenses
Charges paid by borrowers on Interim Fund Credits are paid to IDA as compensation for its services as administrator of the
Interim Trust Fund.

Deloitte Touche

President and Board of Governors
International Development Association
as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund
We have audited the special-purpose statement of sources and applications of development resources, the
summary statement of Interim Fund Credits and the statement of contributions of the Interim Trust Fund, as ot
June 30. 1998, and the related special-purpose statements of changes in cumulative translation adjustment on
Interim Fund Credits, of accumulated surplus and of cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are included in the Annual Report on pages 283 to 293. These financial statements are the
responsibilitv of the Intemational Development Association's management as Administrator of the Interim
Trust Fund. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit. The
special-purpose financial statements of the Interim Trust Fund for the year ended June 30, 1997 were audited
by other auditors whose report, dated July 28. 1997, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements and
included an explanatory paragraph which described the basis of accounting discussed in Note A to the
financial statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of
America and with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis. evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. A.n audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 3udit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying special-purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and applications
of development resources and the Interim Fund Credits, and contributions of the Interim Trust Fund to comply
with Section 2(e) of the Board of Govemors' Resolution of the International Development Association and
Article VI, Section I 1(a) of the Articles of Agreement. as discussed in Note A to the special-purpose financial
statements, and are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting
pinnciples in the United States of America or with Intemational Accounting Standards.
In our opinion, such special-purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the sources and applications of development resources, the Interim Fund Credits, and contributions
of the Interim Trust Fund at June 30, 1998, and the changes in cumulative translation adjustment and its cash
flows for the year then ended, on the basis of accounting described in Note A.
This report is intended solely for the information of the Board of Governors, the International Development
Association's rnanagement as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund, contributors to and borrowers from the
Interim Trust Fund, and members of the Intemational Development Association. However, under the
Intemational Development Association's Board of Govemors' resolution establishing the Interim Trust Fund,
this report is included in the Annual Report of the Executive Directors to the Board of Governors of the
Intemational Development Association and is therefore a matter of public record and its distribution is not
limited.
