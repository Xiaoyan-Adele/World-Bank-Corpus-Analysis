      Investing in Poor People and Empowering Them
      to Participate in Development
      The capabilities of poor people can be increased by
      widening their access to key services and by fostering
      social inclusion. Better access to quality education and
      health care expands opportunities for poor people to
      improve their own well-being. Access to social protec-
      tion is also important--well-targeted safety nets pro-
      tect poor and vulnerable people from the unforeseen
      shocks and dislocations that accompany necessary re-
      forms. To be effective, the strategy must also include
      mechanisms that foster poor people's participation in

    In fiscal 2004 the Board discussed six Transitional
Support Strategies (TSS) for postconflict settings, in-
cluding the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Repub-

West Bank and Gaza, and a TSS update for Comoros.
It also prepared an Interim Strategy Note for Iraq. As
part of its work to engage low-income countries under
stress, the Bank prepared Country Re-engagement
Notes for Liberia and Sudan. In fiscal 2004, 15 Country
Assistance Strategies and CAS Progress Reports were
prepared jointly with IFC. All of the 38 fiscal 2004 CAS
documents have been or are in the process of being

     can thus be prepared more quickly, than full PRSPs.

    As a global development institution with broad
coverage of countries and issues, the Bank often
plays a global strategic role in providing what more
specialized agencies cannot because of their smaller
size or narrower mandate. In carrying out its partner-
ship activities, the Bank plays different roles--leader,
follower, adviser, helper, and so on--depending on
the need.
    At the global level, the Bank is working closely with
its development partners to improve aid coordination
by integrating poverty reduction efforts. (See "Simpli-
fying and Harmonizing Policies and Procedures" in
chapter 4.)
    In countries, the Bank is committed to strengthen-
ing its emphasis on effective development results. A
new poverty report and booklet--both entitled Part-
nerships in Development: Progress in the Fight against
Poverty, 2004--highlight this focus. The report aims to
provide a more comprehensive assessment of how the
Bank works with other organizations to help countries
achieve the vision of poverty reduction embodied in
the MDGs and the Monterrey Consensus. Using
country examples, the publications highlight the broad     security in Bolivia, Columbia, India, Latvia, Uganda,

the combined GDP of all African countries--cost

    The Bank is promoting several initiatives that seek
to sustain growth and diversify the African economy. It
is supporting policy and institutional reforms to im-
prove the investment climate and make Africa a good
business destination. It has worked with regional insti-
tutions to formulate regional integration strategies that
promote the liberalization of intraregional trade, the
harmonization of macroeconomic policies, capacity
building for regional institutions, the growth of capital
markets, and the building of regional infrastructure,
including transportation corridors. The demands are
enormous: Africa's infrastructure needs alone are
estimated at about $18 billion a year.


FOSTERING PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT

EMPOWERING POOR PEOPLE

Project have been extremely effective in channeling
funds directly to communities to build roads, schools,
health clinics, and drinking-water systems. Under the
program, which now covers 28,000 villages and about
35 million rural poor, communities determine their
needs, design activities, seek technical help, and make

      Note: Due to a recalculation of allocations by the system, lending by theme figures may differ from those in the 2003 Annual Report. For the Law and Justice and Public
      Administration sector, changes in figures reflect the retroactive remapping of projects to a new Compulsory Health Finance sector code under this category. For the Finance
      sector, changes in figures reflect the retroactive remapping of projects to a new Compulsory Health Finance sector code under Law and Justice and Public Administration.

      Note: Due to a recalculation of allocations by the system, lending by theme figures may differ from those in the 2003 Annual Report. For the Law and Justice and Public
      Administration sector, changes in figures reflect the retroactive remapping of projects to a new Compulsory Health Finance sector code under this category. For the Finance
      sector, changes in figures reflect the retroactive remapping of projects to a new Compulsory Health Finance sector code under Law and Justice and Public Administration.
      Numbers may not add to totals because of rounding.

     About 1.1 billion people--one-fifth of the world's
     population--live on less than $1 a day. The Bank's
     strategy for fighting poverty in low-income countries is
     based on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
     approach (www.worldbank.org/prsp). This approach
     has resulted in broader country ownership of the

Revitalizing Infrastructure



Infrastructure is a key factor in reducing poverty,
supporting growth, and reaching the Millennium
Development Goals in developing countries. But
existing infrastructure is often poor, access limited,
and funds to improve it inadequate.
    The World Bank supports a wide range of infra-
structure services in transportation; water supply and
sanitation; urban services; telecommunications; and
energy, including electricity and extractive industries
such as oil, gas, and mining (see also "External Evalua-
tion" in chapter 4). It supports infrastructure service
delivery, reform, and institution building through
policy dialogue and physical investments. It also acts
as a catalyst to leverage financial and other assistance
from development partners and the private sector to
support technical assistance. The Bank made a new
commitment in fiscal 2004 to infrastructure with the
launch of the Infrastructure Action Plan.


POVERTY ALLEVIATION, THE MDGs,
AND GROWTH

Estimates show that in the late 1990s infrastructure in-
vestments reduced poverty by as much as 2.1 percent
in low-income countries and 1.4 percent in middle-
income countries. Improving infrastructure services
such as water supply and sanitation is an explicit target
in the Millennium Development Goals, and improving
services such as housing and information and commu-
nication technologies is at least implicit in the goals.
Infrastructure services also have an impact on the goals
relating to health, education, and gender. Increasing
access to clean water, for example, has reduced the

     ments to investment.


    ACCESS, QUALITY, AND FINANCING NEEDS

     The unmet access, quality, and financing needs for in-
     frastructure services in developing countries remain
     staggering. In rural areas in low-income countries, only
     2 percent of the population has access to electricity,
     and less than 2 percent has access to a mainline tele-
     phone. Infrastructure needs are sizable in most middle-
     income countries and in urban areas as well.
        Lack of access is compounded by the low quality of
     infrastructure services. Relative to OECD (Organisa-
     tion for Economic Co-operation and Development)
     countries adopting best practices, energy losses are
     twice as large, water losses four times as high, and
     faulty telephone lines ten times more common in low-
     income countries. Eighty percent of roads are paved in     c. 1955. The Anchicaya dam and power station serve the fast-growing

   Supporting Private Sector Development



      The Private Sector Development Network identifies the
      regulatory reforms, policies, and institutional capacities
      needed to create a vibrant investment climate. Building
      such a climate is crucial to promoting growth where
      poor people live. Research and practice show that such
      growth is key to reducing poverty.
         Growth has not taken hold in many countries,
      despite the important reforms of the 1980s and 1990s.
      Those reforms focused largely on macroeconomic
      stabilization, neglecting important microeconomic
      reforms, including streamlining the rules governing
      the establishment and operation of a business. Such
      reforms are crucial, as many microeconomic factors--
      including laws and regulations, public institutions,
      and civic habits that make it difficult for entrepre-
      neurs to start formal businesses, borrow money,
      and hire workers--limit the potential for economic
      growth.
         The Bank's strategy is to develop a second genera-
      tion of reforms focused on improving microeconomic
      conditions for private sector investment and growth.
      The network is providing better data through new
      survey tools that can be used to analyze the elements
      of a good investment climate and to translate that
      knowledge into Bank lending and advisory services
      that support actual reforms in developing countries.
      The strategy includes promoting responsible business
      practices and corporate governance; targeting support
      for micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises, and
      advancing privatization policies that work in suitable,
      competitive contexts so that the private sector can
      successfully offer goods and services.
         Private sector development work spans many
      parts of the Bank. This cross-cutting theme, found in
      both lending instruments and economic and sector

Bank and IMF staff, collaborating closely with partner agencies, including other multilateral development banks, the Organisation for Eco-

Country Assistance Evaluations
Country Assistance Evaluations examine Bank perfor-
mance in a particular country, usually over the
previous four to five years. They assess how well per-
formance conforms to the relevant Bank Country
Assistance Strategy, and they evaluate the overall
effectiveness of the strategy. The fiscal 2004 Country

Investment Climate Assessment for Poland sought to
identify features of the investment climate that matter
most for productivity, particularly for poor men and

Financial Accountability Assessments, undertaken for
countries such as Djibouti and Uganda, analyzed the
