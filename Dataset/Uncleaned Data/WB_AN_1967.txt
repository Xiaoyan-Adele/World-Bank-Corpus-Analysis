thought to policy and administrative meas-
ures as well as to physical projects that
would accelerate economic development.
We have therefore developed a practice of
organizing expert missions to visit indi-
vidual countries and to draw up compre-
hensive recommendations that serve as a
basis for working out a detailed develop-
ment program.
What we want, in a word, is to encour-
age constantly improving economic per-
formance by our developing member
countries. Not every country can have, or
even profit from, a detailed development
program, but every country can aspire to
have a well thought-out set of policies
which will provide the conditions and mo-
tivations conducive to economic growth.
This is more and more what We find our-
selves talking about with our member
countries-fundamental policies to govern
their day-to-day economic decisions. We
are able to talk about policies and policy
changes not as interlopers but as collab-
orators-and sometimes we give agreed
policies the final measure of support they
need to tip the scales in their favor in the
councils of government.

Note: Calculations on average terms are based on data reported to the Bank by member countries. The terms used in the calculation are, where possible, the original terms
but in some cases may reflect subsequent revisions of terms. For agreements making credit available under general terms applicable to future allocations, the total amount of
credit is shown in the year in which the general agreement is signed at the terms applicable to each allocation. Other debts for which clear-cut terms are not available have
been excluded from the calculation.
