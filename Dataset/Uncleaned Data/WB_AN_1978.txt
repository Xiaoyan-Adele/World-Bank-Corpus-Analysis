As a result, developing countries are becom-  3000
ing increasingly concerned about the ability of
policymakers in the industrialized world to
withstand pressures for the imposition of new
quantitative restrictions.
The most important way in which developed
countries can currently contribute to trade ex-
pansion by developing countries is to refrain  2,500
from introducing new quantitative import re-
strictions and to clarify and tighten rules re-
garding "safeguard" or emergency use of such
restrictions. Other measures that, in theory,
could be taken by industrialized countries would
be harder, in practice, to adopt. Though studies
indicate that it takes about $20,000 worth of
manufactured imports to displace one worker    20
in the developed countries, and that increased
exports to developing countries can create many
of the jobs that would be lost through increased
imports, such shifts do give rise to the need for
adjustment assistance to displaced firms and
workers in developed countries.
Even in the absence of further measures taken                   _0R
by developed countries to liberalize trade with
developing nations, there are steps that the latter
group can take to increase its share of world
trade.
Developing countries frequently discriminate
against their own exports through a combination
of measures that, for instance, encourage the
protection of not-so-infant "infant" industries,
overvalue exchange rates, and that foster pur-
chases at artificially low prices. An increasing
number of developing countries have, however,
systematically begun to adjust their exchange
rate and trade policies so as to eliminate or re-
duce a bias against exports. Strong moves to-
wards liberalization have been made recently
in countries-Argentina and Chile, in particular
-that used to be prime proponents of high
protection. It will be more difficult to reduce
protective measures in developing countries than
in the industrialized world; substantial liberal-
ization would, in the short run, cause serious
disruption of employment and to the balance
of payments positions of many countries. Con-
siderable adjustment assistance would, there-       Average

Senegal, Western Africa's largest rice importer, is
trying to become self-sufficient in a number of
foodcrops. Four projects, supported by IDA
credits totaling $34.5 million, are helping to remedy
this situation. Two of the projects, based on
irrigation, are in the North along the Senegal River.
The other two projects, in the traditional rice-

Bank and IDA Activities
In fiscal 1978, the Bank and IDA helped
finance 44 projects for a total of $ 1,856 million,
compared with 44 projects for $1,570 million
in the previous fiscal year.
Lending for industrial and agricultural de-
velopment accounted for 17% and 30%, re-
spectively, of the total for the Region. As in
the recent past, the Region remained one of the
major recipients (25%) of Bank lending to in-
dustry and development finance companies.
Co-financing provided additional resources
for Bank-supported and IDA-supported proj-
ects. Those additional resources and contribu-
tions are expected to amount to $1,240 million
for 20 projects in II countries.
Major sources of co-financing for projects
were: the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
of Japan ($224 million), the US Agency for
International Development ($74.7 million), the
Saud' Fund (at least $70 million), the Abu
Dhabi Fund (at least $25 million), the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development (at
least $14.5 million), and the OPEC Special Fund

Liberalization of Trade
At a time when the Region has been facing
serious external and internal imbalances and at
a time when the more industrialized countries of
the world are seriously and openly considering a
return to some forms of protectionism, a num-
ber of countries in the Latin America and the
Caribbean area have substantially liberalized
their trade policies. Since 1974, Argentina, Chile,
Colombia, and Uruguay have implemented trade
liberalization programs that have resulted in
substantial reductions in across-the-board tariff
levels. Equally important programs for the re-
duction of quantitative import restrictions have
also been implemented. Moreover, most of the
countries of the area have maintained, and are
operating on, a flexible exchange rate system.
Although there have been, and are, some excep-
tions, exchange rate movements since 1974 show
that the countries have responded fairly well to
price movements and current account develop-
ments.
Apart from the improvements in resource
allocation and the favorable impact these im-
provements have on the long-term growth poten-
tial of the Region, the implementation of these
policies has permitted a sustained expansion of
export earnings, including those of manufac-
tured products.

We have examined the financial statements (Appendices A   Balance Sheet......................Appendix A
through G) of International Bank for Reconstruction and Devel-
opment as of June 30, 1978 and 1977, and for the years then
ended. Our examinations of these statements were made in  Statement of Accumulated Net Income...     Appendix B

accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and  Statement of Changes in General Reserve. Appendix B

portion of its capital stock, as charges against or credits to the  Statement of Subscriptions to Capital Stock and

Standards Board requires that these adjustments, which are
set forth in the Statement of Changes in General Reserve, be  Notes to Financial Statements............Appendix G
included in the determination of net income; however, in view
of the Bank's character as an international organization and
its related financial policies, which are described in the Sum-
mary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies (Transla-
tion of Currencies) and in Note A, the Bank does not deem the
application of this accounting principle to be appropriate in the
circumstances, and we concur with this conclusion.
In our opinion,the financial statements examined by us present
fairly, in terms of United States currency, the financial position
of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at
June 30, 1978 and 1977, and the results of its operations and
the changes in its financial position for the years then ended,
