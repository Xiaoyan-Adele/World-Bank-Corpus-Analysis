-the installation of nearly 1,400,000 subscriber telephone lines
-the construction or improvement of nearly 12,000 miles of roads

million for over 11,000 projects*.

It was against this background that the Bank had its most

rowings by the Bank in the capital markets between July 1,
1968 and June 30, 1969 reached a new high with sales of
US$1,224 million equivalent of bonds and notes. Included
were $851 million of obligations sold to raise new funds to

The World Bank Group is interested in increasng the effi-

investigation and analysis; it must include consideration of

therefore, makes regular reviews of the economy of each ot

imnportant condition for Bank Group assistance, and the Bank
