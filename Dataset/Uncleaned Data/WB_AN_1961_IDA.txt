Development Association is the newest of the international organizations established
as a vehicle for this cooperation. IDA came into existence in September 1960, and,
at the close of its first fiscal year, has extended credits of just over $100 million for
development projects in its member countries.
IDA aims, in the words of its Articles of Agreement, "to promote economic de-
velopment, increase productivity and thus raise standards of living in the less developed
areas of the world." It is an affiliate of the International Bank for Reconstruction and

tirely separate. Like the Bank, IDA helps to finance development projects which have
been carefully selected and prepared; but it provides capital on more liberal terms of
reDavment and is readv to heln finanee a wider ranae of nrniectc thnn the Rnnlc
The establishment of IDA came after many years of discussions of the desirability
of accelerating economic growth in the less developed areas by adding international
funds, repayable on other than conventional terms, to the flow of development capital.
After consultations which began among the member governments of the World Bank
in 1958, th-e Bank's Board or Governors at its Annual Meeting in i959 approved a
United States resolution calling on the Bank's Executive Directors to draft Articles of



Agreement for IDA. The Articles were submitted to governments in January 1960. The
Articles provided that only mem.ber governments of the Bank were eligible to join the
Association, and provided for initial subscriptions aggregating $1,000 million, if all the
members of the Bank became original members of the Association. The initial subscrip-
tion of each original member was proportioned to that member's subscription to the
capital stock of the Bank. A sufficient number of members of the Bank accepted mem-
bersnip to bring the Articles into force on September 24, 1960.
Under the Articles of Agreement, members of the Association are divided into two
groups: Part I countries, consisting of the countries which are more advanced eco-
norrically; anA Part IT countries, c11JLi1i the L ess dcvl opVeUFU 1nations.  e I  t -Wo
groups make their payments on subscriptions in different ways. A Part I country makes
an initial payment of 23% and pays the balance in four equal annual installments; all
these funds are convertible and usable yli the Asso.iation for development . redits.
A Part II country makes its payments on the same installment basis; but of the total,
only 10%-half paid initially and the rest in four installments-is in convertible funds.
The remainder is paid in the member's own currency and may not be used by IDA
without the member's consent.
Part I countries are to be contributors for iDA purposes, altnough tne Association
may extend credits for projects in their dependent and associated territories. All Part
II countries are eligible to receive IDA credits; those assisted may receive a blend of

assisted by IDA ctedits only.
IDA has begun its work at an opportune time. In the era of economic growth and
political change which has followed the war. the demand for develonment canital has
markedly expanded. In a growing number of developing countries, however, the need
for, and the ability to make effective use of, outside capital is increasing faster than the
ability to service conventional loans; some countries have already begun to draw close
to the limit of the debt they can prudently assume on conventional terms. The problem
is comllpounded by the circu1sLanLces or many newly independent countries: tney are
not able to rely to the same extent as before on the financial support of the metro-
politan powers, including guarantees on loans floated abroad; but they have not yet
developed a credit standing of thleir ow  sucient to enable 4-hm t- borrow 1 on
scale they require.
IDA has no policy of allocating its funds in advance. An effort is being made,
however, to assure wide geographic distribution of development creditsf tacing into
4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



account the priority which should be given to the poorer countries. At the same time,
it probablv will be necessary to observe a limit on credits for some countries wllich
could quickly present enough suitable projccts to absorb a disproportionate amount of
ID A runds.
In administering its funds, IDA will have the same regard as the Bank to the
obsenrance by recipient countries of sound financial and economic policies and to the
careful selection and preparation of projects or programs .ich nma be financed. Where
imports of goods or services are being paid for by IDA funds, the Association will
normally require that procurement be based on full international competition.
IDA now has a lengthening list of Drop)osals under investigation all over the world.
They include projects for the development of electric power, transportation, agriculture
and other activities of a kind traditionally finaniced by the Bank. They also include
projects of a kind not hithcrto financed by the Bank: for instance, for municipal water
supply and teclhnical training.
111 I  oLdL1UI1 tu I1 X sple l' UperatioUn aU tile IIC eeu ror tile type of' duevlop-
ment capital that IDA can provide, its resources are small. At the end of the fiscal
year, 51 member governments of the Bank had accepted membership of IDA (15 as
Pahrf I menmiers and 36 as Part I nmemmbcrs) Subscrirptinnc amoiined to the equivalent
of almost $906 million, including $756 million which IDA may convert as needed for
its operations. IDA received payments of $208 million on these subscriptions, including
$178 million in convertible form. Further payments on initial subscriptions are to be
made annually over four years.
The 'Articies of Agreement require iDA to keep the adequacy of its resources
under regular review. The first review is to take place within the first five years of
operation, with reviews at five-year intervals thereafter. The Articles of Agreement also
provide, hlowever, that gencral --orindivi,hual rinrcrases in the- -ubscription of r-lllcbr
governments may be authorized at any time.
Although IDA is a separate legal entity with its own financial resources, it is closely
affiliated with the Bank. The sanme Executive Directors represent rconntriPe tflat are
members of both the Bank and IDA. The President of the Bank is ex officio President
of IDA, and the officers and staff of the Bank serve as the officers and staff for IDA.
This joint administration not only makes for operating economies, but also assures the
effective coordination of the policies and procedures of the two institutions.
IIJA, like the Bank, nas entered into an agreement with the United Nations. Thne
agreement establishes on a formal basis, and includes IDA within, a liaison committee



which has been operating on an informal basis for a number of years. The committee
Consistsf of the Secretary General of the U. N., the Managing Director of the U. N.
Special Fund, the Executive Director of the U. N. Technical Assistance Board, and
the President of the Bank and IDA, or their designated representatives.
OPERATIONS
IDA operations began on November 8, 1960, when the Executive Directors of the Asso-
cciion01 U hldII tllirL fiirs[ecting.
In its first eight months of operations, ending June 30, 1961, IDA extended develop-
ment credits totaling $101 million in four countries. The credits are on identical terms:
each is for 50 years, uvithout interest, Repayment is due in foreign exchange; amortiza-
tion is to begin after a ten-year period of grace; thereafter, 1% of the principal is repay-
able annually for ten years and 3% is repavable annually for the final 30 years. A service
charge of 3/4 of 1% per annum, payable on the amounts withdrawn and outstanding, will
be made to meet IDA's administrative costs. These terms do not necessarily set a de-
tailed pattern for future iDA credits, but they indicate that iDA's assistance is to be
given on a basis strikingly different from the basis on which assistance has hitherto
been available from international sources.

HONDURAS
$9 million credit for highwvays signed May 12, 1961
This development credit, the first to be extended by IDA, will make $9 million
available to Honduras to assist in carrying out a program of highway development and

maintenance. T ne- program lbeing nnanced includes a o6-mlne extension or mne vvesrern
Highway of Honduras, from its present terminus at Santa Rosa de Copan to the border
of El Salvador; the construction of feeder roads in Western Honduras; the continuation
for two years of a highway maintenance program.; and a high way planningsuvy
The highway extension will traverse a region which, although one of the most
populous in Honduras, has remained until now inaccessible bv road and limited mainly
to subsistence agriculture. The new road should stimulate production on existing farms
61



and open new land to settlement; it will also provide the first direct link between Puerto
Cortes on the Caribbean in the north with El Salvador and Guatemala in the south. and
should thus greatly reduce transport costs between the rapidly developing northwestern
region of Honduras and the other tivo countries, contributing to the economic inte-
gration of all three.
SUDAN
$13 million credit for agriculture signed Iune 14, 1961
The Roseires Dam project on the Blue Nile provided the occasion for the first
joinf TDA-\World Bank operation, the IDA credit being extended in conjunction -ith a
Bank loan of $19.5 million. The German Government also took an important share in
this operation by providing, through Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, a long-term loan
equivalent to $18.4 million. A total of $50.9 million is thus being made available to the
Sudan to finance this important extension of irrigation, on which depends the future
development of the country.
The water to be stored by the dam, which will cross the Blue Nile at a point about
66 miles downstream from the Ethiopian border, will more than double supplies available

nearly 900,000 acres under irrigation for the first time, and also greatly to incease yields
and diversify crop production in other areas where water supplies are at present inade-
quate. The dam will be about ten miles long, with a concrete central section 196 feet
high and more than two-thirds of a mile long. Bccause of work interruptions in flood
seasons, construction is expected to take several years.
CHILE

provinces, the country's most important agricultural region.
Existing dirt roads in Southern Chile become impassable during the five-month
rainy season each year; and the damape caused there bV the eartholuakes of Mva 1960
has only partially been repaired. With the help of the credit, about 600 miles of roads
will be newly built or relocated, and 1,600 miles of existing roads will be improved,
providing an integrated all-weather road system connecting the main producing areas



with consumption and processing centers. The benefits of good road transport in the
Southern zone sllould be felt by the whole Chilean economMLy. The ten provinces already
produce about 53% of the country's total agricultural output; with better communi-
cations they could further reduce Chile's dependence on imported produce, agricultural

$60 million credit for highvays signed lune 21.,1961
The credit will cover half the cost of improvements to the National Highways of
india during the first 31/2 years of the Third Five-Year Plan which began April 1, 1961.
The funds will be used mainly for the construction of about 660 miles of highways,
including 19 major bridges, which will open up some of the less developed parts of

and Bombay.
Demand for rail and road transport rose very rapidly vwith tfle growth of agircultural
and industrial production during the Second Five-Year Plan, and this trend is expected
to continue during the Third Five-Year Plan. While the railways must expand to meet
the growing demand for long distance and bulk movements of freight, there is also
pressing need for an improved road network to enable motor vehicle transport to make

system which links the main centers of population. All the works are located in the
region of the Cangetic Plains in n=rtlern India, and in coastal areas around Calcutta
and Bombay where population density is highest, and where 40% of India's vehicles
are registered.

the Articles of Agreement establishing the Association entered into force) to June 30, 1961,
in conformity with generallv accepted accounting principles. Our cxamination of these

auditing procedures as we considered necessary.
