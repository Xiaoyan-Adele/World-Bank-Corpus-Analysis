The Year's Activities by Area
NOTE: In past Annual Reports, it has been the practice to describe
the year's activities of the World Bank and IDA under sector head-
ings: lending for agriculture, education, power, transportation, etc.
In this Report, they are presented on a geographic basis. One reason
is to avoid duplication of the rather complete sectoral analyses which
have been a special feature of the Bank's publication program in fiscal
1972 (see page 73). Another is to respond to widespread interest in
the development of countries and regions, rather than separate seg-
ments of their economies. Each area section includes a list of coun-
tries in the current lending program.

nine staff members to serve with a mission spon-

Note: It will be iioted in comparing this table with Table 10 of last year's Annual Report that much higher loan commitments for the early years are showo in
this table. This is due to an improvement in information on past indebtedness.
i The grant element is the face value of loan commitments less the discounted present value of the future flow of repaymetits of principal and interest, using
the customary rate of 10% and expressed as a percentage of the face value.
(5) Data from grants are taken from OECD (DAC) and IDB sources. Included are grant-like flows (loans repayable in local currencies, bilateral grants, auld UN
agency grants. Figures for grants are on a disbursed basis, while figures for loans are on a commitment basis. The grant elemenit of a grant is 100%.
(3) This column shows the amount of loans for which repayment terms are known.
r1) Does not include publicly guaranteed private debt of the Philippines.
(o) Excludes Israel.
(,) Excludes some suppliers' credits to India for which terms data are not available.
'7) Does not include non-guaranteed debt of the "social sector" contracted after March 31, 1966 by Yugoslavia.
(a) Excludes Brazil.
