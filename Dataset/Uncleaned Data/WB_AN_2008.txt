REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND STAFF

To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed
to be internationally competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and
largely expatriate staff. The Bank Group's staff salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if war-
ranted, is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative
public sector agencies in the U.S. market. After analyses of updated comparator salaries, the Board approved an average
increase in the salary structure of 3.5 percent for fiscal 2008, effective July 1, 2007, for Washington-appointed staff.
     The annual salaries (net of taxes) of executive management of the World Bank Group were as follows for the period July 1,
2007, through June 30, 2008:

a.Because World Bank Group (WBG) staff, other than U.S. citizens, usually are not required to pay income taxes on their WBG compensation, the salaries are set on a net-of-tax basis.
b.Approximate WBG contribution made to the Staff Retirement Plan and deferred compensation plans from July 1, 2007, through July 1, 2008.
c.Other benefits include annual leave; medical, life, and disability insurance; accrued termination benefits; and other nonsalary benefits.
d.Mr. Zoellick receives a supplemental allowance of $75,350 to cover expenses as part of WBG contribution to other benefits. Because Mr. Zoellick is a U.S. citizen, his salary is taxable
  and he receives a tax allowance to cover the estimated taxes on his Bank salary and benefits. In addition to his pension, Mr. Zoellick receives a supplemental retirement benefit equal to
   5 percent of annual salary.
e.Ms. Okonjo-Iweala's appointment was effective December 3, 2007, and her actual salary for December 3, 2007, through June 30, 2008, was $193,652. The WBG contributed

g.These figures do not apply to the U.S. Executive Director and Alternate Executive Director, who are subject to U.S. congressional salary caps.
h.Pension benefits for these staff members are based on Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provisions in effect prior to April 15, 1998.

    Although the decline in world poverty is a positive sign,
poverty reduction has been highly uneven across regions.
In East Asia the goal of halving extreme poverty has already
been achieved: the percentage of people living on $1 a day
is expected to drop to 2 percent (although the percentage of
people living on $2 a day will account for a still significant
15 percent). At the other extreme is Sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite a 4.7 percentage point decline in the share of people
living in extreme poverty between 1999 and 2004, some
31 percent of Africa's population will still be living on less

cent. There are some exceptions, however; countries such
as Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda are making
solid progress toward the MDGs.
    The recent increase in food prices may set back recent
gains in reducing poverty. Preliminary estimates from the
World Bank indicate that the persistence of current food
prices may well translate into losing almost seven years of
progress in poverty reduction, with up to 105 million people in
low-income countries pushed into poverty over the next three

COMBATINGDISEASE
To address pandemics, the Bank expanded funding to several
landmark regional projects, including the Great Lakes
Initiative on AIDS Support Project, the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development HIV/AIDS Partnership Program
Support Project, the Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment
Acceleration Project, and the Senegal River Basin Water
Resource Development Project (malaria). It also established a
new agenda for action in preventing and dealing with the
consequences of HIV/AIDS through 2011 (see http://www
.worldbank.org/afr/aids). Through its booster program for
malaria control in Africa, the Bank committed about
$470 million in IDA resources and trust funds to Sub-Saharan
Africa from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2008--more than nine times
the volume of resources committed between 2000 and 2005.

ADUALCHALLENGEFROMCLIMATECHANGE
In a region that both contributes to global greenhouse
emissions and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate
change, the Bank is working on many fronts. A climate
change and disaster risk management strategy is being
developed for Papua New Guinea, and, with support from the
Global Environment Facility and the Global Fund for Disaster
Relief and Rehabilitation, the Bank is helping six Pacific
Island countries to draw up plans for adapting to potential
impacts from climate change. In China, five major carbon-
trade agreements are bringing financial resources to support
the introduction of cleaner technology in the steel sector,
innovations in biogas reduction from agriculture, and broader
use of lower-carbon liquefied natural gas. At the same time,
the Bank is working with China to reduce greenhouse
emissions by improving energy efficiency, restoring forests,
and investing in renewable sources of energy. In Indonesia,
a major agreement, brokered by the Bank, provides local
government with credits for preventing around 250,000 tons of
