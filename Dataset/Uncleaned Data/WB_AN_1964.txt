ANNEX   The information in this section describes
Bank loans, IDA credits and other activities of both
institutions during the fiscal year. Money amounts are
usually expressed in United States dollar equivalents.
Bank loans to borrowers other than member govern-
ments carry the guarantee of the governments concerned,
and the participations of financial institutions in the
loans were all without the Bank's guarantee.
All IDA credits were made to the governments con-
cerned, on identical terms: No principal repayments are
N,                           to be made for the first 10 years; thereafter 1% per
annum  is repayable for the next 10 years and 3%
per annum is repayable for the final 30 years. The
.. z~;' credits are free of interest, but a service charge of
'4 of 1% per annum is payable on the amounts with-
drawn and outstanding, to meet the administrative
costs of IDA.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in terms of

generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year. Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing
procedures as we considered necessary.

as we considered necessary.
