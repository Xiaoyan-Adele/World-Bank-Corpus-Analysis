Technical Assistance Activities
The petroleum  exporters in the region have
become increasingly aware that their economic
'development could be promoted by a greater                                                         l

earnings. At their request, the Bank is helping
several among them speed up their develop-
ment by emphasizing, in particular, the acquisi-
tion of skills and the creation of institutional
frameworks required for modern economies.
Ninety percent of the technical assistance ac-
tivities extended by the Bank in the region are
being carried out in the eight regional member
states of OPEC; most of the technical assistance
programs are in Iran and Saudi Arabia. The
Bank's technical assistance covers many sectors
and takes many forms, ranging from its role as
Executing Agency for the United Nations De-
velopment Programme-financed  National
Transport Survey of Saudi Arabia, to the adviso-
ry and pre-investment activities of the resident
agricultural mission in Teheran. In both coun-
tries, most of the technical assistance work is
related to major internal investment decisions
the countries are contemplating, and is gener-
ally comparable to the services the Bank pro-
vides in the course of its lending operations. Of
special significance are the studies undertaken     tt
in both countries whose objective it is to help
the authorities in the formulation of their man-
power employment policies as well as thak eirn
education and training programs.
Some other examples of the new relationship
with regional OPEC members are provided by
