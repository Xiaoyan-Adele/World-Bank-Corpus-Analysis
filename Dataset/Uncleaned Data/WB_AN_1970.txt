IDA FINANCING 1961-1970-SOME EXAMPLES
IDA made its first development credits in fiscal 1961. During the past ten years IDA has made
221 commitments, totaling $2,773.1 million net in 55 countries, for agriculture, education,
transportation, electric power, water supply, telecommunications, industry, and project
preparation and technical assistance. Among other things, IDA credits made as of the end of
fiscal year 1970-alone or with supplementary finance from the World Bank or other lenders,
and together with the contribution of the borrowing country-are helping to finance
projects for:
-Bringing under cultivation or improving more than 22,004,750 acres for agricultural
purposes, including: through irrigation-6,127,000 acres in the Republic of China,
India, Pakistan', Ceylon, the Sudan and Turkey; through flood protection and drainage-
12,672,000 acres in India, Pakistan, the United Arab Republic and Indonesia; through land
development (mechanization, cooperatives, plantations)-1,797,840 acres in Africa and Asia.
-Construction or improvement of more than 15,030 miles of roads in Asia, Africa, Latin
America and the Middle East; the engineering of more than 3,709 miles of roads; and the
improvement of road maintenance operations in many of the countries involved.
-Improvement and expansion of railroads in four countries by the provision of more than
5,440 freight cars, 250 passenger cars, track signaling devices, electrification and workshop
equipment, as well as components for the domestic construction of hundreds of locomotives,
thousands of freight and passenger cars.
-Port improvements in six countries by construction of ship berths and passenger and cargo
building and by provision of new dredges, harbor craft, navigation aids and other equipment.
-Installation of about 919,000 kilowatts of electric generating capacity and the extension
of transmission lines in seven countries.
-Improvement and expansion of water supply systems in 16 cities with a total population
of over 6,000,000 located in six countries.
-Construction, expansion and/or equipping of 627 general secondary and specialized train-
ing schools, 52 teacher-training colleges, and eight agricultural universities. These projects,
in eleven African, three Asian and two South American countries, will enable enrollment
to expand by 148,900 in general secondary schools; 31,100 in technical and agricultural train-
ing schools; 7,700 in teacher training colleges; 6,200 in agricultural universities.
'in addition, IDA is a contributor to the $1.2 billion Indus Basin Development Fund, which is financing projects
to irrigate about 5,000,000 acres in West Pakistan.

The availability of agricultural credit for crop
development is assuming increasing importance
with the technological advances of the "Green
Revolution." As a consequence of the new tech-
nology, farmers who were previously barely able      i<
to produce enough to live can now achieve sharp                                    AlJ
increases in production; these formerly marginal
farmers are therefore able for the first time to take
advantage of the facilities for investment in on-    -
farm improvements offered by credit institutions.

Explanatory Notes:
Currency consists of coins and notes in circulation outside banks.
Commercial banks are institutions offeri ng dema nd deposit facilities availa ble for payment a nd tra nsfer through checks. I ncludes
ordinary commercial banks, the commercial department of the central bank and in certain countries, so-called savings banks,
where either they have large demand deposits or their savings deposits appear to be regarded by the holders as money.
Demand depoosits include deposit liabilities due by commercial banks to depositors other than banks and governments, and subject
to withdrawal and transfer by check.
Time and savings de,posits include balances due by commercial banks through passbook or certificate transferable into demand
deposits, but not available for paymevts outside banks.
Anno-banking financial institutions are financial intermediaries which acquire their resources through acceptance of deposits by
passbook or the issuance of credit instruments (promissory notes and bonds), butwhich do not carry checking accounts. These
are largely specialized institutions such as cooperative banks, development banks, mortgage banks and post office savings
institutions.
Claims include loans as well as investments. For this table, claims of banks and non-banking financial institutions are limited
to those on the private sector, in order to provide a measure of the intermediation of the financial system with respect to supply
and demand of funds in the private sector.
Sources: Data based on monetary, banking and other financial institutions' statistics provided by the International Financial
Statistics of the IMF, except for adjustments based on statistical information available from World Bank sources in the cases
of Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, United Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia, and for Brazil and India, for which data have
been obtained primarily from World Bank sources.
