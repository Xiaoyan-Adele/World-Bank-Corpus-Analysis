Selected New Aspects of Project Work
Innovation
Year of introduction                                        Explanation
Agricultural research          In fiscal 1974, 18 out of 51 agriculture projects had research components;
(late 1960s)                   in fiscal 1976, 33 out of 64.
Sensitivity and risk           The sensitivity of the rate of return to different assumptions about uncertain
analysis (late 1960s)          costs and benefits is regularly examined.
Project-related training       Between fiscal 1972 and fiscal 1976, the number of projects with a training
(1970)                         component more than doubled; the amount of Bank financing for this pur-
pose more than quadrupled.
Environment (1970)             Every project is now routinely examined for its environmental implications
(including health), and any protective measures, identified as necessary,
are incorporated into its design and execution.
Income distribution            Distribution of benefits and the impact of the project on different income
(early 1970s)                  groups are examined and taken into account wherever possible.
Cost recovery (early 1970s)    Increasing attention is given to cost recovery arrangements, which balance
the needs for efficient use of services provided against financial, fiscal, and
income distribution considerations.
Development of local           Increased efforts in this area have been under way for some years, in par-
contractors, consultants,      ticular, to provide technical and limited financial assistance to develop local
and other local                contracting industries through projects.

(early 1970s)                  more critically examined and given more attention in project design.
Employment generation          Increasing attention is being given to designing projects to have a positive
(early 1970s)                  impact on employment, for example, through labor-intensive construction
methods and the encouragement of small-scale enterprises.
Sector context (early 1970s)    Project selection and design have been increasingly based on a broad
analysis of sector problems and priorities.
Monitoring and evaluation      Built-in monitoring and evaluation of their progress and impact have
(since 1972)                   gradually become a regular feature of most projects.
Use of remote sensing (1973)   These techniques were applied to project and sector work in 11 countries in
fiscal 1977.
Utility tariff structure       The Bank has always been concerned with the financial adequacy of utility
and policy (water-1972,       tariffs, but has only recently focused on tariff structure and its impact on
power-1974)                   income distribution. Review of the equity and economic aspects of tariff
structure and policy is now an element of virtually every power and water
project.
Sociological and               This element is critical in many newer-style projects and is beginning to be
anthropological aspects        introduced as a regular part of project work.
(since 1973)
Health (1975)                  In the first 18 months after introduction of health components, staff pro-
vided advice on 122 projects and provided direct operational support to
33 of these.
Nutrition and population       In addition to projects in these sectors, increasing attention is being given
components (1976)             to including nutrition and population components in projects in other sec-
tors, particularly rural and urban development.
Social rate of return (1976)   Return calculations taking into account the distributional impact of proj-
ects are still in the experimental stage.
Role of women in               A new advisory position was created and filled in 1977. Involvement of
development (1976)             women is now being explicitly considered in projects, especially in educa-
tion and rural development.
Small-scale enterprises        Lending to development finance companies and industrial estates is increas-
(1976)                         ingly oriented toward small-scale enterprises which generate employment.
Urban poverty orientation      Traditional water and power projects in urban areas are being redesigned
in non-sites and services     to incorporate distribution elements to service poorest segments of the

international recession. Consequently, it ran
substantial current account deficits in both 1974
and 1975. With the recovery in the world econ-

about 45%  in volume, and its terms of trade

planning through both national-level and state-
level action programs.
In fiscal 1977, four state-level agricultural de-
velopment projects in India, whose key compo-
nent is a reorganized and strengthened system
of agricultural extension and adaptive research,
were assisted with IDA funds. The strengthened
extension system  emphasizes concentration of    fA 
pffort, systematic and regular training, close su-r
pervision of staff at all levels, and a fixed sched-
ule of visits to farmers' groups. Initially, the
message carried by extension agents stresses im-    ft

are known to have significant impact on yields
but which cost little in addition to extra labor
input. This approach is especially well attuned
to the needs of small farmers, and the experience
gained, so far, indicates that small farmers have
benefited-as have larger ones.
The agricultural extension service in the west-
ern Terai region of Nepal will also be strength-
ened as a result of a $9 million IDA  credit,         ' w.;

Two loans, totaling $50 million, in support of
agriculture/agro-industrial projects in Montene-
gro and Macedonia are designed to relieve two
major constraints to agricultural development:
the lack of capital for large investment in land
development, irrigation, and food processing fa-
cilities in the "social" sector; and the lack of
market outlets and credit for the purchase of on-
farm  investments in the private sector. Eleven
agricultural processing enterprises and agricul-
tural cooperatives will be provided credit; these
facilities will, in turn, provide service to farmers
in the private sector. Credit will also be made -
available to about 1,000 private farm families,
60%  of whom have annual per capita incomes
of below $340, to increase primary production.

Agricultural output, however, increased by only
2% yearly during the same period, and actually
declined on a per capita basis. The inevitable
result was stagnating incomes for the 55%  of

Bank and IDA Activities
World Bank lending to the Region increased
to $1,893 million in fiscal 1977, or 31%  over
fiscal 1976 totals. The number of projects as-
sisted rose from 42 to 48. Of total lending, some
$42 million in loans was approved on Third
Window terms; IDA credits (there were four,
three of which were combined with Bank loans),
amounted to $25 million.
* Rural poverty has been a growing concern of
agricultural development policy in many coun-
tries in the Region, and the Bank has continued
to support efforts in the rural sector to increase
agricultural production and to improve the in-
comes and standards of living of small farmers.
One example is the first IDA-assisted (with a
$10 million credit) rural development project in
Haiti. The low standard of living of the coun-
try's population, in terms of nutrition, sanitation,
literacy, and other criteria, combined with a
general lack of the basic infrastructure of trans-
port and other facilities, call for a major develop-
ment effort; this is handicapped, however, by
administrative limitations and a lack of technical
expertise. The Government has, therefore, pur-
sued a strategy of focusing on regional rural
development projects in the country's most fer-
tile and densely populated rural areas, rather
than dissipate limited financial and technical re-
sources in nationwide programs. In line with this
approach. the project is located in an area-the

rural population lives at levels of absolute pov-    Colombia's telecomanications netuork hos beet
