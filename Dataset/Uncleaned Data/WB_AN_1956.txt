FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
WASHINGTON, D. C.
We have examined the financial statements listed below of International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development as of June 30, 1955. Our examination was made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly
included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
In our opinion, such financial statements, with the notes thereto, present fairly
the financial position of the Bank at June 30, 1955, expressed in United States
currency, and the results of its operations for the twelve months then ended,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with that of the preceding year.

APPENDIX I
Loans and Advisory Assistance
COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY SUMMARY
This Appendix contains a country-by-country description of the operations
of the Bank in the past fiscal year. For each country in which the Bank was
active, information is given on one or more of the following topics: loans
made; negotiations and surveys looking to possible loans; general survey
missions and other kinds of advisory services. Loans that were made to
borrowers other than member governments have the guarantee of the member
government concerned. The interest rates shown include the 1% commission
which, under the Bank's Articles of Agreement, is allocated to the Bank's
Special Reserve. The loan amounts in the tables are expressed in United
States dollars and are net of cancellations and refundings.
Appendix F, beginning on Page 10, gives additional details on all of the loans
made by the Bank since the beginning of its operations. That Appendix
shows among other things amounts committed, purpose of loan, interest
rates, maturity dates, amounts disbursed and repaid, and amounts sold to
other investors. Descriptions of the projects for which loans were made in
previous fiscal years may be found in the Annual Reports covering the fiscal
years during which the loans were made.
