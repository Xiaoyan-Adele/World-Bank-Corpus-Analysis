Capacity Building and Diagnostics The World Bank
Institute (WBI) helps policy makers from client countries
develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities that will enable
them to improve governance and stem corruption. In
cooperation with the Bank's lending program and partner
institutions, the Institute delivers participatory learning
programs that help local government leaders formulate
specific institutional reforms. In fiscal 2005 WBI helped
civil society organizations from Benin, Guatemala, Guinea,
Sierra Leone, and Zambia to develop governance and
anticorruption assessments.
   WBI and the Bank's Development Economics Group
produce the Worldwide Governance Indicators, which assess
more than 200 countries and territories on key dimensions
of governance.These indicators are widely used by policy
makers, donor agencies, and social science researchers.
(See "Capacity Development" in chapter 3.) (See www
.worldbank.org/wbi/governance.)


Law and Justice Courts and other justice institutions are
vital to good governance and the fight against corruption, as
they enforce the rules governing economic and social interac-
tion. Since 1991 the Bank has funded more than 1,500
law and justice activities in 140 countries.These include 17
freestanding justice projects that were active in fiscal 2005.

Tackling Risks and Uncertainties Affecting Developing
Countries
Poor countries face risks and vulnerabilities that stand
in the way of sustainable development.Water insecurity,
commodity price volatility, extreme weather variability,
and natural disasters affect growth prospects. Ecological
risks--caused by climate change, biodiversity loss, depletion
of fisheries stock, and unsustainable practices such as illegal
logging--threaten the availability of natural resources for
productive purposes and wealth creation. Social imbalances,
weak institutions, and political instability lead to conflicts,
which deter development efforts.
   The Bank is addressing these issues with a suite of
interrelated sector strategies on agriculture and rural

REDUCING CONFLICT
Conflict is estimated to cost affected African countries 2.2
percentage points of economic growth each year. In collabora-
tion with NEPAD, the Bank is working to achieve peace and
stability.These conditions are needed if countries in the region
are to attract foreign investment and increase their exports.
    In fiscal 2005 the Bank provided assistance to 17 conflict-
affected countries and low-income countries under stress (see
chapter 3). It also worked to increase transparency and reduce
incentives for illegal trade in commodities linked to conflict,
such as oil, gas, diamonds, timber, and precious metals.
   A key objective of NEPAD is to help build capable and
effective states that provide basic services, promote equity and
security, and create an enabling environment for investment,
wealth creation, and wealth sharing, particularly through the
peer review mechanism. In support of this objective, the Bank
directs more than 20 percent of its new lending toward public
sector governance. Interventions cover expenditure manage-
ment, civil service reform, decentralization, accountability
mechanisms, and legal and judicial reform.

support fosters accelerated human development in the region     to develop information technology that will improve public
by focusing on four cross-cutting issues: equity and inclusion, service delivery, increase private sector competitiveness, and
public accountability, HIV/AIDS, and regional integration.      bridge the digital divide.
   A strong component of the Bank's strategy is its analytic
and advisory work (see chapter 3). A recent report on fiscal
decentralization to rural governments in India reviewed
panchayat council finances and made recommendations for
improving the system.The Bank discussed a poverty and
vulnerability study on Afghanistan, completed a study on
persistent malnutrition in India, and completed a gender
assessment of Pakistan, which is under discussion with the
government. (See www.worldbank.org/sar.)
   Partnerships with other development agencies are play-
ing an increasing role in the Bank's assistance in the region.
Support for human development is strong. Sectorwide
approaches, as well as development policy loans, are becoming
the norm for health and education operations in Bangladesh,
India, Nepal, and Pakistan.
   A new Country Assistance Strategy for India was discussed
by the Bank in fiscal 2005.The strategy underscores equity
and inclusion by signaling a shift in emphasis toward lagging
regions, such as Orissa, one of the country's poorest states.
   (See also the IFC and MIGA annual reports.)


BUILDING THE CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT
The Bank completed several investment climate assessments
in South Asia in fiscal 2005.These included the Bank's first
postconflict assessment of Afghanistan, a third assessment of
India, the first subnational assessment (for the Indian state
of Orissa), and a rural and urban assessment of Sri Lanka.
Together with IFC and MIGA, the Bank held workshops for
stakeholders on this work throughout the region.
   The Bank approved $100 million to support the reform
of tax administration and $300 million to support banking
sector reforms in Pakistan. It also approved a $400 million
loan to support India's rural roads program and a $620
million loan to improve part of the national highway system
in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It approved a $120
million loan to India to support the development of small and
medium enterprises and a $53 million credit to Sri Lanka

BUILDING THE CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT
Across the region the Bank is assisting countries in their
efforts to reduce the red tape that hinders private sector
development and to address the poor logistics that make
products costly and businesses unprofitable. Major financing
to the region in fiscal 2005 included a $658 million loan to
Brazil for programmatic fiscal reform and social security
reform; a $250 million loan to Mexico to support innovation
for competitiveness; a $200 million loan to Argentina for
sustainable investment in infrastructure; a $200 million loan
to Colombia for labor reform and social structural adjust-
ment; a $100 million loan to Peru for improving decen-
tralization and competitiveness, along with a $200 million
guarantee facility; and a $150 million loan to the Dominican
Republic for strengthening the power sector.
   To help identify priorities for public expenditure
reform, the Bank carried out public expenditure reviews of
Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, St. Lucia, St.Vincent and
the Grenadines, and Uruguay in fiscal 2005. It completed
investment climate surveys for Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador,
and Guatemala and launched surveys for Costa Rica and
Jamaica.The results of the survey for El Salvador were used
to design the first development policy loan for the country
and provide benchmarks for monitoring and evaluating the
loan.The Bank conducted other analytic work on growth
and competitiveness, trade reform and labor market risk,

the Republic of Yemen. It also conducted analyses of trade
logistics in Syria and the Republic of Yemen and funded an
export development project in Tunisia.
   Efforts to improve the investment climate go beyond
reducing business costs and ensuring enforcement of contracts.
The Bank is working to foster good corporate governance in
Egypt. In Iraq it is supporting capacity building to manage the
transition to a market-based economy.
   Improving infrastructure services requires providing a
better investment climate for service providers.The Bank is
helping governments to better manage their public resources
through competition and to improve regulation to facilitate
private participation. Egypt is leading the way in this area,
with the Airports Development Project. In Algeria, Iraq, and
Tunisia, the Bank is supporting the modernization of informa-
tion infrastructure services through private investment.
   In countries struck by natural disaster, restoring basic
infrastructure is critical to reviving the local economy. In
response to the 2004 earthquake in Bam, Iran, the Bank
is supporting the reconstruction of telecommunication and
transport infrastructure.

                                             Country lending reflects the Bank's focus on achieving the
                                          MDGs. It is tailored to individual country needs, with lending
                                          instruments that are becoming increasingly flexible.

   The two most prominent themes were human development
and rural development, accounting for 19 and 17 percent
of IDA commitments, respectively. Major attention was also
paid to financial and private sector development (16 percent),
public sector governance (16 percent), and social protection
and risk management (8 percent). Figures 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6
show IDA commitments by region, theme, and sector.


IDA Resources
IDA is financed by its own resources and by donor govern-
ments. Every three years donor governments and representa-
tives of borrower countries meet to discuss IDA's policies
and priorities and to agree on the amount of new resources
required to fund IDA's lending program. Historically, the
major industrial nations have been the largest contributors
to IDA. Donor nations also include developing countries and
transition economies--some of them current IBRD borrowers
and former IDA borrowers.
   Negotiations for the 14th Replenishment of IDA (IDA14)
concluded in February 2005.The IDA14 agreement, which
governs the use of IDA resources for fiscal years 2006-8,
provides 24.2 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs)(about
$35.3 billion).This amount includes SDR14.1 billion (about
$20.7 billion) in new donor contributions; SDR8.7 billion
(about $12.7 billion) in internal resources, including repay-
ments of principal from past credits and investment income;
and SDR1.1 billion (about $1.5 billion) in IBRD net income
transfers, subject to approval by IDA's Board of Governors.
Donor countries made firm financial commitments to the
replenishment, but some are still exploring the possibility of
increasing pledges to reach the 30 percent target increase in
commitment authority supported by IDA donors. (See figure
3.7 for the sources of IDA funding, and figure 3.8 for IDA's
impact on social sector efforts.)


Low-Income Countries under Stress
Effective engagement with low-income countries under stress
(LICUS) is essential for long-term development and global
security.Work continued this year on increasing the effective-
ness of aid, with the Bank providing close oversight of progress
in the 25 most fragile states. Heightened operational readi-
ness and close partnerships with other donors allowed fast
and flexible support in postconflict countries such as Haiti,
Liberia, and Sudan.To improve links between security and
development, the Bank and the United Nations Development
Group developed the Transitional Results Matrix, a planning
tool that helps countries prioritize and enhance the coherence
of international support across political, security, economic,
development, and humanitarian arenas.

                                          impose on their neighbors and the inequity of aid allocations
                                          between "aid darlings" and "aid orphans."This led to an
                                          agreement for the Development Assistance Committee of
                                          the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

                                          Bank also cosponsored a senior-level forum,"Development

                                             The Bank implemented several institutional reforms to
                                          improve its response in LICUS.The Country Policy and
                                          Institutional Assessment rating system was amended to
                                          recognize performance improvements at the bottom of the

                                          Debt Relief and Debt Sustainability
                                          The Bank continued to provide debt relief to the world's poor-
                                          est and most heavily indebted countries in fiscal 2005. It also
                                          worked to improve debt sustainability in an effort to help these
                                          countries meet the MDGs.
                                             Under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
                                          Initiative (www.worldbank.org/debt), 27 countries are now
                                          receiving debt relief that is expected to total more than
                                          $54 billion over time. Eighteen countries have reached the
                                          "completion point," where debt relief becomes irrevocable.
                                          In fiscal 2005 the boards of the Bank and the International
                                          Monetary Fund voted to extend the HIPC Initiative through
                                          December 31, 2006. Unlike previous extensions, this one
                                          applies only to countries that satisfied HIPC income and
                                          indebtedness criteria as of the end of 2004.
                                             The debt relief program has significantly reduced debt stock
                                          in HIPCs (see figure 3.9) and has allowed poverty-reducing
                                          spending in those countries to rise (figure 3.10).
                                             Together with the International Monetary Fund, the Bank
                                          has developed a framework for assessing debt sustainability
                                          in low-income countries that will guide lending decisions in a
                                          way that balances a country's need for funds with its ability
                                          to service debt, and in a manner tailored to the country's
                                          circumstances.The framework reflects feedback from exten-
                                          sive consultations with government officials, multilateral and
                                          bilateral donors, academics, and civil society organizations.

productive employment; reducing poverty and inequality;
reducing volatility, particularly in their access to private
financial markets; and strengthening the institutional and
governance structures that underpin viable market-based
economies.The Bank is uniquely placed to help these countries
craft institutional reforms, attract infrastructure investment
across the public-private spectrum, improve social service
delivery, and cope with volatility.
   To support the development efforts of middle-income
countries, the Bank began implementing an action plan in
fiscal 2005 designed to strengthen the ability of its staff
to respond to these countries' borrowing needs. Initiatives
include piloting the use of countries' own environmental and
social safeguards and fiduciary systems, where applicable;
streamlining policy conditionality; and making greater use of
the flexibility of Country Assistance Strategies to customize
support to country circumstances, respond quickly to emerg-
ing opportunities, and realign investment lending instruments
and disbursement mechanisms with the evolving needs of
clients.The plan leverages Bank resources and skills to
provide timely, relevant, and high-quality knowledge services
that draw on Bank Group synergies and partnerships with
bilateral and multilateral agencies.


The Role of IBRD
IBRD is a AAA-rated financial institution--with some
unusual characteristics. Its shareholders are sovereign
governments, each of which has a voice in setting its policies
and many of which are eligible to borrow from it. IBRD's
main goal is to reduce poverty by promoting sustainable
economic development in middle-income and creditworthy
low-income borrowing countries. It provides financing (loans,
guarantees, and related risk management tools) and expertise
in development-related technical disciplines.
   It helps clients gain access to capital and financial risk
management tools in larger volumes, on better terms, at
longer maturities, and in a more sustainable manner than
they could receive from other sources. Unlike commercial
banks, IBRD is driven by development impact rather than
profit maximization.


Eligibility to Borrow from IBRD
In fiscal 2005 countries with a per capita income of less than
$5,295 that were not IDA-only borrowers were eligible to
borrow from IBRD. Countries with higher per capita incomes
were able to borrow from IBRD under special circumstances
or as part of a graduation strategy.The amount IBRD is willing
to lend eligible countries depends on their creditworthiness;
some countries with poor creditworthiness may not have

                                          access to IBRD resources. Some countries that are

                                          incomes are also able to borrow from IBRD. IBRD loans
                                          outstanding to any individual borrowing country may not
                                          exceed $13.5 billion.


                                          IBRD Lending
                                          At $13.6 billion for 118 operations, new loans, guarantees,
                                          and guarantee facilities by IBRD in fiscal 2005 exceeded the
                                          previous year's level by over $2 billion.This represents the
                                          highest volume of IBRD lending in the past six fiscal years.
                                          The share of development policy­based lending was slightly
                                          lower than in fiscal 2004.
                                             Latin America and the Caribbean received the highest level
                                          of IBRD loans and guarantees, with $4.9 billion or 36 percent
                                          of total IBRD commitments, followed by Europe and Central
                                          Asia with $3.6 billion and South Asia with $2.1 billion.
                                          Lending was slightly less concentrated than it was in fiscal
                                          2004.Whereas five countries received roughly 57 percent
                                          of total lending in fiscal 2004, five countries--Brazil, China,
                                          Colombia, India, and Turkey--received a combined commit-
                                          ment volume equaling 53 percent of total IBRD lending in
                                          fiscal 2005.
                                             Among sectors, public administration, including law and
                                          justice, received the highest volume of IBRD lending ($3.4
                                          billion), followed by transportation ($2.1 billion), and water,
                                          sanitation, and flood protection ($1.6 billion).
                                             The thematic composition of lending in fiscal 2005 was
                                          led by financial and private sector development, followed
                                          by environmental and natural resource management and
                                          social protection and risk management. Figures 3.11, 3.12,
                                          and 3.13 show IBRD lending by region, theme, and sector.

                                          IBRD Resources
                                          IBRD obtains most of its funds by selling bonds in interna-
                                          tional capital markets. In fiscal 2005 it raised $13 billion
                                          at medium- to long-term maturities, roughly the same as in
                                          fiscal 2004. Debt securities, with a wide range of maturities
                                          and structures, were issued in 13 currencies.
                                             IBRD is able to borrow high volumes for long maturities
                                          on very favorable terms. IBRD's financial strength is based on
                                          its prudent financial policies and practices.These help IBRD
                                          maintain its high credit rating.
                                             As a cooperative institution, IBRD seeks not to maximize
                                          profit but to earn enough income to ensure its financial
                                          strength and sustain its development activities. IBRD's net
                                          income, excluding net unrealized gains (losses) on nontrad-

ing (borrowings related) derivative instruments, as required
by Financial Accounting Standard 133 and International
Accounting Standard 39, was $1,320 million in fiscal 2005.
IBRD retained $589.5 million in its general reserve and
$68 million in its pension reserve, added $52.5 million to
the surplus account, and transferred $400 million to IDA
and $210 million to the HIPC Trust Fund. (See Financial
Statements on the accompanying CD-ROM.)
    IBRD maintained adequate liquidity in fiscal 2005 to
ensure its ability to meet its obligations. As of June 30, 2005,
it held about $26.4 billion in liquid assets.
   As of June 30, 2005, IBRD's outstanding borrowings from
capital markets were about $91.5 billion (net of swaps) (see
figure 3.14).Total disbursed and outstanding loans were
$104.4 billion. Borrowings exceeded equity by a factor of
about three.
   Consistent with IBRD's development mandate, the principal
risk it takes is the country credit risk inherent in its portfolio
of loans and guarantees. Risks related to interest and exchange
rates are minimized. One summary measure of the Bank's risk
profile is the ratio of balance sheet equity to outstanding net
loans, which is closely managed in line with the Bank's finan-
cial and risk outlook.This stood at 31.4 percent as of June 30,
2005 (see figure 3.15).


PARTNERSHIPS
Globalization has brought about dramatic changes that
require collective action by public, private, and civil society
stakeholders.The Bank works with partners to manage
global, regional, and country programs where partners share
knowledge and play a joint role in funding, governance, or
management.These programs have become an important line
of business for the Bank. During fiscal 2005 the Bank worked
in consultation with key partners to develop a strategic
framework that will improve the Bank's selectivity and guide
its support to high-priority programs with potential for strong
development impact. (See "Evaluating the Bank's Work" in
chapter 1.)


Trust Funds
World Bank­administered trust funds foster partnerships by
mobilizing and directing concessional resources to support
poverty reduction across a wide range of sectors and regions,
supporting clients in achieving development results at the
global, regional, and country levels. Much of the recent growth
in these funds reflects the international community's desire
for the Bank to help manage broad global initiatives through
multilateral partnerships, such as the Global Fund to Combat
AIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Global Environment
