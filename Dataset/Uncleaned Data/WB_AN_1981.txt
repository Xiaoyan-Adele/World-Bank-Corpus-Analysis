Other Financial Operations: Bank
As of June 30, 1981, the Bank held loans
valued at $54,090 million. This amount included
$6,552 million in loans approved but not yet
effective and $528 million in loans to the Interna-         4,721
tional Finance Corporation (IFC). The total of
loans disbursed and outstanding was $25,958
million, including $474 million to the IFC.
Total disbursements on loans to countries
amounted to $5,063 million in fiscal 1981, up
$700 million from last year. Since the Bank
began operations, it has disbursed a total of
$38,064 million to its borrowing member coun-
tries.
Repayments of principal on the Bank's loans,
based on exchange rates at the time of disburse-
ment, amounted to $1,419 million in fiscal 1981.
This included $147 million to investors who had
purchased portions of loans. Cumulative loan
repavments as of June 30, 1981. were $12,466
million-S9,571 million to the Bank and $2,895
million to purchasers of loans.
Borrowings: Bank
The World Bank's borrowings in international        2,528
capital markets constitute the principal source of
funds for financing its lending operations. The
borrowings are supplemented by the other prin-
cipal financial resources of the Bank, which are
its paid-in capital, accumulated earnings, and
loan repayments.
The Bank borrowed the equivalent of $5,068.8
million in fiscal 1981. This does not include $646
million that was borrowed at the end of fiscal
1980 and credited in advance to the borrowing
program for fiscal 1981. This amount was
included in the 1980 Annual Report. The advance
borrowings for fiscal 1981 included two issues,
totaling S500 million, of Eurodollar notes, mark-
ing the first borrowing by the World Bank in the
Eurodollar bond market, a public issue in the
amount of SwF 100 million, equivalent to $61.3
million, and a private placement in the amount
of DM 150 million, equivalent to $84.8 million.
During fiscal 1981, the Bank also considered bor-
rowing operations that were subsequently
postponed because of volatile market condi-
tions.
The World Bank sells its securities in two
categories of market: First, it places bonds and

with this conclusion.
In our opinion, the financial statements examined by us present
fairly, in terms of United States currency, the financial position of
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at June
30, 1981 and 1980, and the results of its operations and the
changes in its financial position for the years then ended, in
