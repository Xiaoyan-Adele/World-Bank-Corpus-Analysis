Review of Structural-Adjustment Lending
Structural-adjustment lending was begun in 
fiscal 1980 in response to the markedly deterio-
rated prospects that were then foreseen for
developing countries during the 1980s. These
gloomy expectations derived from the problems
of stagflation in many parts of the developed
world, high interest rates, growing protectionist
sentiments, increased oil prices, and the climate
for concessional aid.
How a country chooses to adjust to the inter-
national situation is crucial to its future. Adjust-
ment in the long term can be achieved through
reductions in investment and human-resource
development programs or through a program of
financial and structural-adjustment measures,
supported by external borrowings. Borrowing in      -

Structural-adjustment lending was designed
to provide maximum support, within the staff    -                _

within its mandate, to those governments that

(USS millions. Fiscal years.)                   cost currency at a cost no greater than that which
it would have paid had it borrowed this currency
directly.
During fiscal year 1982, the IBRD also
executed, in markets outside the US, its first US
dollar/Swiss franc-linked bond issue. The pur-
pose of the issue was to tap a market in which the
obligation, while denominated in US dollars,
would, in effect, offer the investor the benefit of
a Swiss franc asset. The IBRD offered the $100
million Swiss Franc-Linked Bonds 1989 through
a syndicate of international banks with Swiss
Bank Corporation as lead manager and Credit
Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland as the
other managers. The bonds and coupons were
denominated in US dollars, but had a Swiss franc
value based on the exchange rate established at
the time of the offering. Although pavments of
interest and principal will be made in US dollars.
the amount to be paid in each case will be the
greater of the dollar face value of the coupons at
the rate of 65/8 percent or of the bonds, or the
dollar equivalent amount of the Swiss franc value
stated on the coupons or the bonds.
By engaging in this type of transaction, the
, . ,  _           IBRD was able to broaden the base of the Swiss
r-  = < # _        franc market for its borrowings, achieve a lower
coupon than the cost of a conventional Swiss
franc issue, and reduce its issuance costs. From
the investor's point of view, the appeal of the
issue was enhanced from a traditional Swiss
franc investment by guaranteeing a floor rate of
exchange at the time of the issue. Further, the
maturity, which was shorter than for traditional
public issues denominated in Swiss francs, was of
particular interest to Swiss franc-based inves-
tors. In addition, by enlarging the syndicate
group to include non-Swiss banks, the market
for the IBRD's bonds was broadened.
Fiscal year 1982 also was marked by the
IBRD's first Eurokrone bond issue; a total of
Nkr 100 million ($17.2 million equivalent) was
placed with nonresidents of Norway by an inter-
national syndicate headed by Den Norske Cre-
ditbank.
The IBRD sells its securities through direct
placement with governments, government agen-
cies, and central banks, and in the public
markets where securities are offered to investors
through investment-banking firms, merchant
banks, or commercial banks. Of the seventy-five

I On August 9, 1979, the Executive Directors decided that the Association's commitment authority not be reduced by the amount of deficits in fiscal
year 1980 or during the period of the sixth replenishment of the Association's resources. In order to reflect this decision, the resources available for
commitment have been increased by the amount of the accumulated loss for the period July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1982.
2 Commencing on July 1, 1980, undisbursed grant participations in development credits have been included with development credits held by the
Association. As a result of this change in accounting treatment, the resources available for commitment at the beginning of the fiscal year 1981 have
been reduced by $13,012,000.
3 The net shortfall in resources of $891,777,000 shown above represents (i) $201,018,000 of subscriptions and contributions to the sixth
replenishment available and not yet used for commitment as of June 30, 1982 and lii) a shortfall of $1,092,795,000 which is attributable to
exchange rate fluctuations in the value, in terms of current United States dollars, of resources expressed in other member currencies and provided in
prior fiscal years. The value of these resources at any given time may be greater or less than the development credits committed against them, since
these development credits are denominated in United States dollars or special drawing rights. If a shortfall should make it necessary, repayments on
earlier development credits would be available for meeting the Association's disbursement obligations. Resources provided under the sixth
replenishment may also be used for this purpose, if necessary.

management believes that it would be consistent with General
Counsel's opinion with respect to the valuation of certain of the
Association's subscriptions and supplementary resources, to also
substitute the special drawing right (SDR) for the 1960 dollar as
the measure of the development credit repayment obligations of
the Association's borrowers. However, this would require approval
of the Executive Directors and involve other changes in the
development credit agreements. Accordingly, until these events
have occurred, the repayment obligations will not be revalued.
In our opinion, subject to the effects, if any, which may result upon
the resolution of the matter referred to in the preceding para-
graph, the financial statements examined by us present fairly, in
terms of United States currency, the financial position of Interna-
tional Development Association as of June 30, 1982 and 1981, the
results of its operations and the changes in resources available
for commitment for the years then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.
