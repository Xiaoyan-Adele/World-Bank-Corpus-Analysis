Annual Report
The World Bank is committed to achieving
and communicating results.
In its ongoing dedication to overcoming poverty and creating
opportunity for people in developing countries, the Bank is making
progress both internally and in the field, and it continues to improve
the way it serves its client countries. This year the Annual Report
showcases the World Bank Corporate Scorecard, which includes
a snapshot of country results achieved by partner countries with
support from the Bank. As we are fast approaching 2015, the target
year for reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the
inclusion of results indicators this year is particularly relevant.

On the cover of this report, you will see some results that our partner
countries achieved through Bank-supported projects around the
world. These results, accomplished mostly over the past decade,
illustrate the efforts of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association
(IDA), which together comprise the World Bank.

We encourage you to read the chapters on the enclosed CD-ROM to
learn more about the World Bank's work; its activities and outcomes
in the six regions; specific results throughout the developing world
over time; comprehensive lending data and a World Bank lending
presentation; and full financial statements. Multiple links are provided
throughout the text to connect you with even more information.
We invite you to visit the websites for the Annual Report, Corporate

Message from Robert B. Zoellick

The past five years have been a time of testing for
the World Bank Group and our ability to respond to
the needs of our clients. Developing and developed
countries have been challenged by the triple
threat of the food, fuel, and financial crises. They've
faced hunger, poverty, joblessness, and debt‚an
economic, social, and human crisis with political
implications. Through these difficult times, the
World Bank Group has stepped up to support our
clients with flexibility, speed, innovation, and a focus
on results. Out of challenge, we have looked for
opportunity and hope.
     The World Bank Group‚s shareholders have supported our priorities and
performance with first-rate financial support. In 2007 and 2010, two record-breaking
IDA replenishments raised more than $90 billion. In 2010, shareholders backed the
IBRD‚s first capital increase in more than 20 years. Today, we have a well-resourced
Bank with an AAA rating.
     We have been modernizing multilateralism for a world economy with multiple
poles of growth and democratizing development through greater openness and
accountability, sharing knowledge and information. We are laying the foundations
for expanding social accountability, fighting corruption, and building better
governance. We have maintained our focus on the poor in all regions, especially
Africa, emphasizing the need for fiscally responsible human safety nets to protect
the most vulnerable. At the same time, we have customized new products for the
middle-income countries that are increasingly important drivers of growth. Our
agenda has included gender equality, food security, climate change and biodiversity,
infrastructure investment, disaster prevention, financial innovation, and inclusion.
     The World Bank Group has paid special attention to the central role of the private
sector in development. We are supporting the enabling environment for investment
and private sector activity; extending financing to small and medium-sized
businesses and microfinance; supporting trade finance; promoting greater attention
to public-private partnerships; and encouraging investment in countries that need it
the most, especially conflict-affected and fragile states.
     In fiscal 2012, the World Bank Group committed $52.6 billion in loans, grants,
equity investments, and guarantees to its members and to private businesses. IBRD
commitments totaled $20.6 billion, compared with $26.7 billion in 2011. IDA, the
Bank's fund for the poorest countries, made commitments of $14.8 billion, compared
with $16.3 billion in 2011.
     This Annual Report incorporates the World Bank Corporate Scorecard, a focused
snapshot of the Bank's overall performance. Its purpose is to help Management and
the Board of Executive Directors to evaluate progress and pinpoint programs and
initiatives that require improvement.
     Results are at the core of the Scorecard. You can read about many of the Bank's
achievements in the ‚World Bank for Results 2012‚ chapter on the CD-ROM that
accompanies the printed version of this Annual Report. This year, we have placed the

majority of our content‚such as the Bank's response to the global economic crisis
and the six regional briefs‚in electronic formats, to reflect readership preference,
reduce paper, and lower costs.
     One important area of the Bank's results is in ‚Gender Equality and
Development‚the theme of World Development Report 2012. The lives of girls
and women have changed dramatically over the past decades: today, more girls
and women are literate, in school, in the labor force, and living longer than ever
before. Yet women still fall behind in earning and productivity, pre- and post-natal
care, and in the strength of their voices in society. The main message of the Report
is that gender equality is both a core development objective in its own right as
well as smart economics‚enhancing productivity and improving prospects for
the next generation. The report points to priority areas for policy going forward,
including closing gender gaps in female mortality, education, access to economic
opportunities, and voice and influence within society.
     The World Bank's staff are tackling these and other challenges with new and
innovative tools. They range from PforR (Program for Results), a lending instrument
that specifically ties funding to results; to the OKR (Open Knowledge Repository),
an open-access home for our research outputs and knowledge products; to SABER
(Systems Approach for Better Education Results), a global information base that will
help guide education system reform. This year‚s Annual Report showcases how these
and other programs have been central to helping us better support our clients‚ needs
over the past year.
     This marks my last message to you as President of the World Bank Group. I want
to thank our Governors, Board of Executive Directors, and other partners for their
guidance and support in advancing the work of this vital institution. Most of all, I want
to thank the Bank Group‚s leadership team and the committed, hard-working, and
thoughtful staff. You are the ones who bring the work of development to life, in all
quarters of the globe. It has been my privilege to serve with you.

Message from Dr. Jim Yong Kim

I am pleased to transmit the 2012 Annual
Report of the World Bank. This report highlights
the achievements and effectiveness of the
institution, despite a challenging global economic
environment. It also underscores the importance
of collaboration across the World Bank Group and
working with external partners to advance our
shared goal of building prosperity and eradicating
poverty.
    Today, the World Bank Group has a unique
opportunity to accelerate inclusive and sustainable
growth and social progress. We are continuing
to support our clients as they respond to immediate pressures, especially through
helping countries develop cost-effective social safety nets. But we are also
well positioned to assist countries as they design and implement longer-term
development strategies through our lending, knowledge, experience, and expertise.
    I look forward to working with the Board, our partners and clients, as well as the
Bank Group‚s dedicated staff in Washington, DC, and around the world. Our mission
remains more important than ever‚to help developing countries respond to
immediate pressures, as well as look toward future opportunities. It is a privilege to
undertake this great work.

   The World Bank's Commitment to Results:
   The Corporate Scorecard
   The Corporate Scorecard provides information on the Bank's overall performance and results
   achieved by its clients. The Scorecard facilitates dialogue between Management and the
   Board on progress made and areas that need attention. Introduced two years ago, the four-tier
   Scorecard covers the full spectrum of IBRD and IDA activities.
       Tier I provides the Global Development Context‚the indicators show the long-term
   development outcomes that countries are achieving, and provide the context and direction for
   the Bank's work. These high-level outcomes cannot be attributed directly to the Bank, because
   countries and their development partners all contribute to these achievements over the
   long term through a combination of multisector interventions, actions, and policy decisions.
   These indicators are also affected by external factors such as global crises. Tier II is Country
   Results Supported by the Bank. This tier highlights development results that countries have
   achieved with Bank support. Tier III, Development Outcomes and Operational Effectiveness,
   provides information on the effectiveness of the Bank's operations and services. Organizational
   Effectiveness and Modernization, Tier IV, assesses how well the Bank is functioning and
   adapting to better support countries in achieving results. In addition, the Bank operates a
   comprehensive web-based results reporting system.
